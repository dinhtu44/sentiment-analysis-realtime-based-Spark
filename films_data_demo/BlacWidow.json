Hands down it's one of the worst.I saw a lot of people talking about Florence Pugh's performance, and that surprised me, not if she was bad or something, her performance was actually good, but you guys saw better performance than David Harbour's? He stole the show\nHe's the best thing in the movie, his comedy scenes killed me, honestly without him I'd rate the movie 4/10\nScarlett Johansson's performance is Scarlett doing Black Widow, not Scarlett doing Nicole from \"Marriage Story\": A lot of superhero poses and 0% effort of doing action scenes without a stunt double.Rachel Weisz's performance was just meh.In any movie -especially a superhero one- I'd love to see a good villain like Thanos or Loki and so on.In this movie, I saw a bad-written one, he has absolutely no motive for his actions, I know he's a metaphor for masculinity and how a lot of men shutting females' mouths and control their actions, but the metaphor wasn't enough, I wished for more, I wished for a better character with real motive.In the end, it's not a bad movie, but it shall have been a better one.It's an average Marvel movie, just don't expect much, and you'd have fun."}, {"reviewer_name": "nicole_perkins", "date": "7 July 2021", "text": "Black widow had a very strong first half, then it completely derailed. The villain was barely in the movie and was a complete waste. As a female, I love black widow and was so excited for this film. Natasha has always been my favorite superhero, in the comics and in the MCU. I've seen every marvel movie in the cinemas and was literally bouncing off my seat waiting for it to start. Was also so thrilled for the movie to have a female director, finally! But let me tell you, in all honesty I was so disappointed with this movie, and this is coming from someone who was anxiously waiting for a Black Widow movie. The action scenes were way too forced and tremendously exaggerated, and on top of that the CGI is just meh. The plot is so predictable and sloppy, very flat storytelling. The last act doesn't even feel like something a MCU movie would have, considering how popular and good other MCU movies were. This movie could have been so much better, like the insane opening sequence seemed to imply. However, I loved the comedic and the family moments in the film and those got some good reactions out of me.This movie does not feel like a final sendoff of Natasha Romanoff or even in close attempts to complete Romanoff's story arc. Florence Pugh and David Habour give stellar performances in this movie. After some time without Marvel movies, this movie is more of just an escapist popcorn fun and thats all. With all this in mind, the movie did atleast make me happy in wanting to watch more of Pugh's amazing future performances in the MCU. I am so excited to see Yelena in the future. Pugh definitely gained a fan.

I watched the Black Widow last night... I am sorry to say, but I'm so disappointed... MCU really has a problem with female hero movies and this is their lowest point by far, which is a pity because both Scarlett Johansson and Natasha Romanoff deserved much much better.I really don't understand where the need for totally exegarated and over the top action scenes came from, Natasha Romanoff is more than capable, but she is only human and in the movie she could be Thor himself, no difference at all. The story could've been passable if not for terrible inconsistency and skipping-jumping all over the place. The beginning felt so very off, nothing about it felt warm and likable, the overly sciency explanation of the fireflies to the 5yo felt so out of place even later when we realized their true identities. The Red Room has been handled awfully. Natasha's backstory is really tragic and the Red Room's legend by itself provide so much potential for great storytelling, even if it is just something to speed over, but that part of the movie was just a mess of unrelated photos and sequences where you can't see which part is Natasha, which is Jelena, nor anything else except for bunch of supposedly targets I guess. These theme was so much better handled in Agent Carter even if there too it was just a few scenes to brush over, it still had so much more impact than what is done here, and this was supposed to be a movie about the most famous girl that came out of that place! And this is just the first 5 to 10 min of the movie, however the rest doesn't get much better, since it is terribly unbalanced mix of action scenes (with the girls being totally indestructible which really bothers me), comedy and tragedy backstory. And when I say terribly unbalanced, I mean it, one sec you are laughing at something Alexei did or said (which is problematic by itself) and the next you are abruptly interrupted because, you know - tragic backstory, how could Natasha ever laugh or be happy or whatever... I really hated that about the movie, the forced comedy, the forced tragedy, the forced action, everything is forced... And I am not even going to into details with the worst part of it - the villains! Aside from the main guy who was made throughout the movie like some all powerful monster - which he's not, he's a pathetic old man with a power fetish like most of them are, his main guy, the one who's supposed to be one of the toughest Marvel antagonists was reduced to unbelievable, pathetic backstory, diminished in everything that makes him a great character in comics and is used only as a device to drive the plot forward without anything to like, fear or admire. Such a dissapointment! So, in conclusion, this was a very bad movie I don't intend on watching again."}, {"reviewer_name": "RinoBortone91", "date": "11 July 2021", "text": "The problem with the latest Marvel movies is that the studios want to get their hands on directors' visions and especially on the characters themselves, destroying content with very high potential, ridiculing it with squalid and out of place jokes, with characters reduced to the bone, introduced and never deepened. A colossal flaw of the latest Marvel films, like this one, is that despite the talent of the directors and the vision they have, there is always the production to dismantle everything, in fact you can already notice it from simple things like a plethora of cross-cutting, like when there is a fight (or something big in progress) and suddenly attention is diverted to another scene, thus throwing smoke in the viewer's eyes, because this specifically cross-cutting is for this purpose and not because it's needed. Another waste of potential by Marvel Studios, despite having fun, stellar cast, great vision, cinematography and some good amazing ideas, but we must admit that already the current Marvel TV Series are clearly superior in terms of themes, exploited potential and much more.

However, I do expect some level of competence.I will say, though, Pugh was outstandingly good. She came across as committed (unlike Johansson) and like she actually wanted to be in the movie (again, unlike Johansson).Most of the action was well done, too.Other than that, this movie wasn't good at all."}, {"reviewer_name": "harry-31155", "date": "8 July 2021", "text": "I want to start by saying I'm not the sort of person who likes to ruin other people's enjoyment of any piece of entertainment, but there were times watching this in the cinema where I either laughed at a scene that was supposed to be straight faced or rolled my eyes all the way to the back of my head. Please only read this review if you've actually seen the movie.One thing that REALLY annoys me about the dialogue in Marvel movies - sarcasm, why does everyone have to be so sarcastic? Sarcasm doesn't work as levity when every single sentence has it, there's no subtlety to it at all. Most egregious is when David Harbour's character is escaping from his neo-industrial cyber prison whilst on comms with Black Widow and she tells him to not cause a scene...immediate cut to him causing a scene, yes that works that's funny but the very next shot is Black Widow saying \"you caused a scene didn't you?\" in the same tone one mentions spilled milk, completely ruining the gag.CGI, I have no problem with it, it lets films reach visual heights that were previously confined to the realms of dreams...so why use it for a shot of a car turning a corner on a mountain? Like I said I have no problem with CGI when used properly, but it seems to be used almost out of laziness here, towards the beginning there's a shot of a plane landing in Cuba and it looks so unbelievably phoney I'm sure a 15 year old using After Effects could have produced a more striking result, it's hard to immerse yourself in this cinematic world when even the most simple things look artificial, if one of those fancy futuristic VTOL jets looks artificial then you can absolutely suspend your disbelief but it simply doesn't work on the same level for something that could easily be achieved without the use of computers.And the final thing that really annoyed me about the film (other than the John Lewis advert Nirvana opening theme), it holds your hand throughout the whole narrative, not letting the audience work things out themselves. Major spoiler territory here you've been warned. When Rachel Weisz's character tells Black Widow that the \"Red Room\" have been alerted it should be obvious that she's doing it for Black Widow's benefit, not because she's a double agent, the next five minutes are spent with David Harbour trying to re-establish his \"fatherly\" bond with Florence Pugh, so it's obvious that it's all going to plan - there's no fighting, no Black Widow telling everyone they have to get out of dodge, just that...so why did they include a flashback sequence that shows that it was intentional after we've already gone to the Red Room with them? We've already worked that out! The exact same crime is committed when Ray Winstone's character explains that Black Widow cannot attack him as long as she can smell his pheromones, so naturally she makes him break her nose, cool. But then there's ANOTHER flashback sequence where Rachel Weisz explains to the audience that Black Widow has to break her nose in order to attack him...WHY? Again, we've worked that out! It was pretty bloody obvious....anyway, enough ranting.David Harbour's character is genuinely funny, good performances all round (except for Ray Winstone) and it's definitely enjoyable enough to justify seeing, but you will be feeling like a pretentious cinema elitist every time you shake your head."}, {"reviewer_name": "FrankThePatriot", "date": "10 July 2021", "text": "Folks, DO NOT waste your money watching it either in theaters or on Disney +.

I am so disappointed that Marvel could put this junk out, they really did not do justice to the Black Widow character. Just another over the top, overused CGI snorefest.The writers make Natasha into an indestructible human that could rival a super soldiers powers, yet she is just a human with bones that are apparently unbreakable?!?!? A helicopter falls from the sky and everyone just walks away. Also, The Red Guardian??? Huh? Locked away in a Russian prison and it seems even though he could have broken out any time he wanted he didn't.Nothing against Ray Winstone but he can't keep a Russian accent to save his life. His English accent destroys what could have been a decent scene. She cannot attack Draykov because the smell of his pheromones prevent her from hurting him? But by breaking her nose it unlocks the power to be able to defeat him. That was not too predictable at all and he never even saw it coming. (Insert sarcasm here)The only shining star is Florence Pugh's acting but that was not even close to saving this movie from a 2 star rating.This could have been such a good story/movie but as usual, lazy writing and a huge fan base will unfortunately make this movie a financial success which will encourage Marvel to produce more garbage that their fanboys will eat up and stand in line to give their money to these studios.

All the rest feel like okay action, with okay directing, within an okay (but weird) storyline. I could say that this movie is slightly better than okay (almost good) if it was not for three crucial facts. 1) Black widow is dead, so why would we care? And 2) the \"family\" drama and relationship feels very forced and weird since they barely seen each other and have no real relationship. And 3) Taskmaster is treated as horrible as possible in this movie. Absolutely atrociously done and yet another character from the comics is forever tainted.Florence Pugh is the star of the movie. She is just as excellent in this as she is in everything else she does. Great actress and if she is replacing Scarlet in the MCU that is a clear upgrade.Scarlet and Pugh in scenes together is mostly a plus, although I think it is a bit too much a times, especially when Scarlet tries to banter like she is Spiderman... Music score is pretty great, and CGi, as norm with Marvel. Is on very high standard. But everything else is just okay.I simply did not feel it. This move offered nothing, filled no void, and nothing interesting to say, and managed to destroy a villain character. Is it nice to look at and is the action good? Sure.. but why should we care?Black Widow has never been a A-list character, in fact her comics have never sold and she has always been a background boring addition to some teams. That they took her into the Avengers and MCU worked because of script, overarching story and the people around BW/scarlet. When BW/Scarlet need to be on her own, she is overshadow by her \"sister\", and we do not care because she is already a dead character. Scarlet is (just as her character) not a box office winner, she never was, and she never will be.Hard to grade this. I think anything from 4-7 of 10 is viable. I ended up giving it a 5/10.

The hero has to be able to show weakness or else the whole movie becomes make belief gibberish that would have satisfied moviegoers in the 90s or early 2000s but nowadays is easily identified as hollywood trash by the contemporary viewers.We know that people take damage, we know that after people are tossed from a building they would take at least half an hour to be able to walk straight. We know that explosions would burn the hell out of you and make you scream out in pain if you are too close to the source. These are all well known and established common sense expectations only distorted by mediocre movie makers of the past.Thankfully movies like John Wick, Nobody or any Tarantino movie shows how it is done right. The heroes may seem invincible but they take damage, they have to take a breath after fighting two guys at once, they bleed and stumble profusely due to the injuries, the explosions seems to hurt them substantially and maybe most importantly they also do get hurt. You can explain these realistic key aspects away by making the protagonist a super human soldier, or a god even, as marvel does but when a sole human is the hero you cannot and should not.Black widow hence becomes yet another cliche action flick where the hero gets to run a marathon after realistically having broken more than a few bones after a fight.

Florence Pugh was excellent in the film and the chemistry between her and Scarlett Johansson was great. Good fighting sequences except for parts of the third act where the CGI was very noticeable. Plus that end credit scene was amazing. One of my only complaints is that Marvel stated you wouldn't need to watch the shows to understand the movies but if you hadn't seen falcon and the winter solider the end credits may not make a 100 percent sense.

Scarlett's \"Natasha\" character was a bit too intense, too serious throughout so that wasn't endearing, however \"Yelena\" was spunky and funny when ribbing Natasha about her action poses, and the \"Red Guardian\" was awkwardly funny throughout, too, so those elements can't be denied. But some elements of the plot towards the end went stupidly implausible and things ended up a little too tidy instead of the mess it should've been which would've led better to any sequel.

Alot of flashbacks and strange editing choices too.In the end, this could have really been any Spy/Action film. Black Widow herself can't pull an entire movie by herself.

I'm not trying to say that there aren't any good movies about Russia, of course (quite the opposite, actually), but come on. After seeing so many awful movies of this kind? From Police Academy: Mission to Moscow, to A Good Day to Die Hard? Let's just say I expected the very worst from this one. It's like with all of those old musicians nobody cares about anymore. Nobody wants to hear your performance in the rest of the world? Go to Russia. They'll be glad to have at least somebody performing for them there. That's just how it works. You have absolutely no idea how to fill the gap between one MCU phase and another? Why, let's just give 'em that \"evil Russians\" bull. I knew it won't end well. I bloody knew it...But guess what? I was wrong. Because this movie? It's even worse than I expected. Way, WAY worse. And it comes from a person who loved Captain Marvel and even enjoyed Venom quite a lot (here, said it). But this movie? Nope. Because first - it IS forced as heck, and second - the quality level here is really, REALLY low. I believe there was that awful Russian Avengers rip-off a few years back? Called Guardians or something like that (don't google it, you don't need THAT in your life)? Well, Black Widow is almost as bad. Still not EXACTLY as bad, but honestly, don't even think Avengers here. Think something more like The Wolverine (2013), or Dark Phoenix (2019). It's forced, the storyline barely exists and the entire thing is, like, a long (more than two hours) series of cringeworthy moments. Most of which feel painfully random. There's literally no proper development here. Things just... happen. Because they do. Action scene here, some family talks there... the script feels like it was done in one sit. By somebody who didn't even care. And don't even let me start with the humor. I mean, sure, it's hard to imagine the MCU without its humor, but what we have here? Let's just say that after this movie, The Last Jedi will look like a bloody masterpiece to you. Guess, we all had that guy at school. The one that didn't have any sense of humor at all but still tried to be funny all the time? Well, the man finally wrote his own script and sold it to Disney. Enjoy.I really wonder what happened here. I mean, I can't even say that this movie is bad because of some certain thing that ruins everything. Like you know. The terrible humor that killed The Last Jedi. Here? It's just that. An overall quality. Or, to be precise, the complete lack of it. Watching the Black Widow? It's like buying one of those expensive action figures from eBay and ending up with Chinese knock-off because of the shady seller. You get your popcorn, you get your coke, you start with a lot of the expectations for something cool, expensive and inspiring (it's a modern comic-based movie we're talking about after all), but instead... you get a bunch of random cringeworthy moments (seriously, watching this movie is exactly as painful as watching the Police Academy 7) covered in some painfully generic action scenes (da heck with that obvious Arkham Knight rip-off anyway?) and cheap CGI. Because yes, even the visuals are surprisingly disappointing this time. Most of the time those will be just meh, but sometimes? Sometimes it'll be like a bloody Russian Cyberpunk Farm mockumentary from YouTube (google this one, the humor there is way better than what you'll find in Black Widow). Seriously guys, what... the heck?!!So... yeah. Even if you already have the Premier Access subscription, let's just say that you can do way, WAY better than this nowadays. Seriously, with stuff like WandaVision and Loki? Why do we even have something this crappy for a big screen format? Like I said, I do love comics and usually, I don't have much problems even with some pretty poor adaptations. But this? This is just wrong. I know that in Russia they usually just steal the entire movie budget and then bribe the right people to pretend that the crap they're about to release is an AAA product that will make the country proud. But until today I didn't know that Russian traditions are contagious. In every single aspect Black Widow fails to deliver us our usual MCU experience and ends up feeling more like a Chinese knock-off. I give it ten Uwe Bolls out of ten and hope I'll never need to see it again.

Or mostly solo - she's joined, at times, by her \"unique\" family: father Alexi (Harbour), mother Melina (Weisz) and sister Yelena (Pugh). There's plenty of backstory there and it's well handled.Having Pugh & Harbour actually added way more humour than I was expecting, which was good to see and helped keep things moving. However, this is primarily a Bond-style action-packed car-chase into explosion into hand-to-hand-combat film. And that's what 'Black Widow' should be - she has no super-powers, after all. The plot involves Natasha going after \"the Red Room\", which is the spy agency that programmed her to be an assassin. Dreykov (Winstone) and the skull-helmeted semi-cyborg (no spoilers!) are OK as the bad guys, even if they don't have that much screen time.Pretty satisfying conclusion, with the post-credits scene linking back into some of the Marvel TV shows. I enjoyed all the scenes with Harbour, but Pugh steals the show, with some solid stunts/fights, but mostly her well-placed quips. It's also a fitting conclusion if this is the last time we see Johansson as Black Widow, as she's so assured in the role that you feel light at home when she's on screen.

It has to have been intentional. Look, I get that many female actors don't want to be defined by their attractiveness. But what we see here is more than that, it is a bizarre neutering that is forced. Johansson is a very good actor but her sex appeal is very significant amount of her draw, and to deny that, or try to erase it is just childish.

Finally a MCU movie focusing on more serious real-world issues instead of unrelatable fantasy. It felt darker, deeper, and closer to home. Shortland took the MCU and added spice, some artistic flare, a dose of reality, and a powerhouse cast - and quickly turned it into the first and only MCU movie with a character I could relate to and look up to. I've been yearning for film like this since I was a child.PROS:\nTHE NARRATIVE:\nThe MCU has served as a source of decent entertainment for years, but something always seemed to be missing. If you're content with attractive white men with good morals running around killing generic bad men, you've probably enjoyed Marvel's idealist American narrative of the \"perfect, unkillable, attractive white male hero\" until now. But the rest of us have been sick of this for ages. From Jason Bourne to James Bond to Mission Impossible to most MCU movies, the cinematic universe has been wrought with perfect untouchable men parading around while the rest of us roll our eyes buckle in for yet another movie we can't relate to.Black Widow shattered that narrative.I was sitting in the theatre about 20-30 minutes into the movie, trying to figure out what it was missing. Then it hit me - we had gone a half hour without a single portrayal of the perfect all-American man. There was no intelligent, attractive, funny male protagonist who was on his way to get the girl, get the job, save the world, etc. I can't remember the last time I sat through any type of media and there was no idealist male protagonist introduced within 30 minutes. In fact, no perfect male is introduced at all throughout the entire movie - and it left me reeling and surprisingly content.Better yet, we went throughout the entire movie without the women - the stars of the show - being sexualized. Cate also didn't give in to other tiring tropes either - none of the women were focused on romance, none of the women were portrayed as dumb airheads, and perhaps most importantly they weren't utilized for the male gaze or viewership ie. Bond girls.Overall, in terms of gender norms and narratives, Cate Shortland shattered the generic, super hero narrative and rewrote this film to fully and genuinely focus on women as the powerhouses they have the right to be. She gave me an experience in film that I'm not sure I've ever experienced before - Black Widow is well and truly for women, by women, and cleared the stage to make them the true stars of the show. I have been waiting for a real and true female protagonist movie for millennia and didn't expect to find it in Black Widow, but here we are.THE CAST:I thought that Natasha's \"family\" was wonderfully cast and added a lot of depth and reality to the film. Florence Pugh was wonderful (as always) and her chemistry with Scarlett was notable. Harbour and Weis were hilarious together, and their comedy carried the film in many ways.ARTISTIC CHOICES:I was surprised and delighted by the deeper, darker, more chilling atmosphere of the film, and thought that the introduction - the first 30-45 minutes - were directed masterfully. I loved the cinematography, and the editing in the intro seemed more purposeful than most MCU movies. Hair, makeup, and costume were very exciting as well - I can imagine young women already planning out their Halloween outfits and adding more braids to their hair styling routine. The composer - a favourite of mine, Lorne Balfe, did a great job as well at creating a chilling atmosphere.Cons:the action sequences were unbelievable, in typical MCU fashion. Physics and gravity have left the chatPugh and Johansson rarely acted as if their injuries were serious enoughPugh seemed a little stiff in the scene where she made fun of natasha's fighting stance - she struggled to get down and up, and whether for comedic effect or not it did not seem characteristic of a top tier killerVery VERY typical American depiction of the soviets as bad. When will THIS narrative in Hollywood end????the villains were built up to be amazing and strong, and yet were taken care of - fairly indirectly - in a quick manner. Explosions and falls were the real reasons the villains perished and/or stopped fighting (ie widows). They didn't put up much of a fight, either.unbelievable hair, makeup, and outfit transitions (did Pugh's captors literally undo her braids before the intended surgery??)Overall, this movie was refreshing and had great acting, chemistry, comedy, and for the MCU - artistic flair. I found it more relatable and realistic than an MCU movie before. I want to thank Cate Shortland for keeping this film true to women.Any negative reviews are either from die-hard MCU fans or people who cant handle strong emotions, people caring for others, sensitive topics regarding women's rights, or strong female characters."}, {"reviewer_name": "paul_haakonsen", "date": "9 July 2021", "text": "Right, well I am not one that gets all excited whenever Marvel puts out a new movie, given the fact that I am not particularly keen on the superhero movie genre.

Sure, I watch the superhero movies because they provide adequate entertainment and have over the top special effects, and that is about it.So of course I ended up watching \"Black Widow\" as well, as I was presented with the opportunity to watch it. I went in expecting little in terms of proper entertaining, believing it to be yet another visually astounding experiences that covers up for a shallow storyline.And I was actually genuinely entertained and surprised with the outcome of \"Black Widow\".

I liked the story told here, and it definitely added depth to the Natasha Romanoff character (played by Scarlett Johansson).Visually then you will be in for another top notch special effects galore, as with all other Marvel superhero movies. The special effects teams that worked on \"Black Widow\" definitely delivered, and then some. This movie was through the roof.The action scenes in \"Black Widow\" were fast paced and adrenaline filled, which was something that really appealed to me.\"Black Widow\" does have a good ensemble of actors and actresses on the cast list, with the likes of Scarlett Johansson, Florence Pugh, David Harbour, Rachel Weisz and a short appearance by William Hurt.I have no doubts that the 2021 movie \"Black Widow\" from director Cate Shortland is not going to please the fans of the MCU, as someone like me (not at all a fan of the superhero genre) could be more than genuinely entertained.My rating of \"Black Widow\" lands on a seven out of ten stars."}, {"reviewer_name": "mashpotatoe", "date": "7 July 2021", "text": "Never been a fan of black widow, always thought she was a bit of a joke since she doesn't actually have any super powers compared to the rest of the avengers so I was really surprised how good this was!

This film honestly had the potential to be something great: it had the budget, the talent, and a well known main character. Nearly every issue with this film stems from the screenplay.The biggest issue? The antagonist. Dreykov is one of the worst MCU villains to date. The script made him a fragile old man who has a quick temper, but doing this literally ruins his role as an antagonist. Antagonists are supposed to be strong and intimidating, and if not, then smart and manipulative. Dreykov has none of those attributes, and at this point, I don't know if it was a good thing or a bad thing for him to get such little screen time. He also emits a pheromone that makes it so that no one can attack him if they smell him, so there's that I guess.The plot is also really uninteresting. The film takes most of its time trying to find Dreykov, but how could I be interested in finding Dreykov if I never saw him before. Also, the motive for finding Dreykov is that he mind controls black widows, and he controls an evil organization. So we want to get to Dreykov for the most basic reasons, and we never saw him before, great job with creating a strong plot, screenwriters.There are tons more problems with this film, but this review would be too long if I started listing them all, so lets get into the good parts. The action is really good. The choreography was great and the action scenes were creative and grand. Weirdly though, the CGI suddenly got a lot worse at the end. Scarlett Johansson did a solid job, but Florence Pugh carried a lot of the heavy load. David Harbour was supposed to be the comedic relief, but the best jokes came from Pugh. Her character is also pretty likable, so I guess that helps a lot.Overall, Black Widow is lightyears away from being perfect. The plot is long and uninterestingly weak. The main antagonist can literally be some ones grandpa, and the supporting characters were all bland, with the exception being Yelena. There are great action scenes, but action can't carry any movie, even if its an action movie. This film is a 3/10; I was originally going to give it a 5, but the more I kept writing, the more I realized how flawed this movie is. Now I'm just hoping Marvel Studios and Disney do a better job with their next movies."}, {"reviewer_name": "adammssauve", "date": "9 July 2021", "text": "The story is very basic, with little imagination. The action scenes felt forced.. the comedy fell flat.

But, I'll do my best.First off; the prologue took me completely by surprise. I had no idea that small-town \"American\" family were actually Russian spies till they actually started speaking Russian! David Harbour was particularly convincing as the Red Guardian. A man developed as the Soviet Union's Capt. America. But. Unable to prove it during Cap's icy incarceration. So, his talents were \"wasted\" on a long-term undercover assignment.Then, comes the flash-forward where we see Scarlet Johannson, as grown-up Natasha Romanov, on the run from SHIELD for violating what I sarcastically call the \"Short Leash Accords\" enacted by the United Nations in the wake of CAPT. AMERICA: CIVIL WAR.Enter Florence Pugh as Yelena, one-time \"foster\" sister of the Black Widow. She tells BW about how their ex-KGB handler has gone power-mad. Intending to start a new wave of international terrorism using hundreds of brainwashed young women agents!The attempt to stop him involves breaking the Red Guardian out of prison so they can reunite with their one-time \"foster\" mother Melina (Rachel Weisz of CHAIN REACTION and MUMMY fame). The only scientist smart enough to neutralize that brainwashing.The fight scenes and special visual effects dominate, of course, as is to be expected in any superhero movie. But, what's made Marvel Films a little more successful at it than, say, their Distinguished Competitor is the way the former emphasize the human side of being superhuman.For example; the way Natasha and Yelena argue (in a semi-good-natured way) about the almost-seductive way Natasha comes out of her leap-down crouches is almost truly sisterly. With the latter calling the former a \"poser\" almost as if she's jealous! Although, I don't honestly see why she should be.The way her long blonde ponytail waves back and forth, when Yelena emerges from a similar crouch, is almost as hypnotic as watching a stopwatch. ;-)In any event, I loved going to see this movie and I heartily recommend it to everyone else who wants a pleasant, action-packed time-killer this summer. Of course, half of you reading this will no doubt be asking yourselves \"If he liked it so much, why not give it a perfect ten?\"The needless feminizing of the Taskmaster. \"Nuff said.\""}, {"reviewer_name": "bobronhan", "date": "10 July 2021", "text": "Hey Disney, remember your place is to entertain us.

Marvel basically just needed to recreate existing good movies and it would have done well. The cinematography and fist fights were so obviously trying to mirror the Bourne movies, but the writers/choreographers didn't seem to realize that those movies did well because they had well thought out and intelligent action scenes. Black Widow had so many impossible physics moments it was embarrassing.The story was similar. There are tons of good spy movies, but this one never really explained the point of any major plot points, and the explanations they did give were either convoluted or they were told in such a disjointed manner that the point was unclear. Meanwhile it took a ridiculous amount of time to redundantly explain minor details. The supposedly well-trained spy sister was an idiot for risking 100% of the antidote in 1 move. After that move worked out, there should have been a huge conflict as the liberated minds took sides and/or tried to figure out what to do next. Surely the villain wasn't stupid enough to completely abandon the previous brainwashing techniques to rely solely on some experimental chemistry that allows people to create the antidote even while they are supposedly under complete control, right? Well he did try to protect himself from a team of elite snipers using a method that only works when his enemies are within a couple feet (a meter) of his body, so maybe he really is that dumb.But the movie's biggest problem by far was how they completely wasted Taskmaster. She could have *easily* been the main villain in a full Avengers movie with some *epic* buildup and suspense as she learns their moves and starts beating them at their own game. Instead they abandon all tension and degrade her down into yet another emotionless and motiveless karate master, as if the MCU doesn't have enough of those already. Because they trashed the character, it made the gender change (he's a male in the comics) seem like pandering moreso than actually promoting diversity. Also, the villain put a ton of emphasis on the fact that Taskmaster was controlled by a chip in her brain, not the same chemical treatment as the other assassins, so there's no reason why the antidote should have worked on her.The helicarrier crashing scene could have been cool, but instead they ruined all of the cool moments by adding absurdly unbelievable moments like Black Widow easily catching a hand rail with her bare hands after a full speed 50 ft drop. It would have been pretty epic if they had cut all the Taskmaster scenes and replaced them with an extended helicarrier escape scene in the same style as the newest Tomb Raider games/movie. Could have really solidified Black Widow as a badass human instead of the plot-armored tensionless popcorn action that they gave us.The best parts of the movie were Pugh's (Yelena) performance (even with the occasionally cringe-worthy dialogue she was given) and the Red Guardian, who was truly funny and could have been even funnier in the hands of a competent screenwriter."}, {"reviewer_name": "DeadMansTrousers", "date": "10 July 2021", "text": "First off as others have stated Florence Pugh is the highlight of this, her performance was fantastic and in my opinion she saved the movie.This was originally supposed to be an origins film but instead it takes place after Civil War.

And as a whole, the MCU did a fairly good job at giving us escapist entertainment that took us into all kinds of wondrous worlds, indeed.Well, say goodbye to that and hello to the new Marvel. As with many other franchises, the MCU has also been taken over by creatively unremarkable activists, turning franchises into vehicles for preaching and \"putting men into place\", as an Indiewire article so formidably put it.You see, men are either evil or dumb (when they are white), and women are generally abused and in need to break free from the patriarchy while actually being smarter and more capable. And Black Widow delivers this narrative in a spectacularly simplistic manner. There he is, the old white man in his castle in the clouds, enslaving what the film seriously calls the most overabundant resource in the world: girls. Black Widow can't hurt him, because of pheromones, get it? But she breaks free from his animalistic attraction by hurting herself and frees all the poor patriarchy-brainwashed women by literally giving them the red pill (well, more like a gas, but close enough).Interestingly enough, the effect of the gas looks more than a poison to me - makes you think, doesn't it?Nah, don't think. Just consume. Because apart from the painfully clumsy agenda, this movie has no consistency, no logic, no point - another unnecessary proof of today's lack of writing skills. Still, there are some good parts as well.For starters, Scarlett Johansson is a good actress. And even if Black Widow isn't nearly as intriguing an Avenger as others might be, I would have loved a good solo movie, just to see Johansson shine in her own film. Well, I didn't get that. Instead, I got yet another boring lecture about how (white) men are bad and how women are the actual saviours. Again. And again. Still, Johansson manages to capture in her rare character moments, and this is no small feat, given the material. I mean, at least we got her - imagine Brie Larson as Natasha Romanoff!The score was actually decent, and I feel like I bashed Lorne Balfe a bit too soon. Given this score, I'm very willing to forgive the atrocious score for The Tomorrow War and look out for the next one. A chance that Junkie XL will never get from me again - not that he needs it anyway.The CGI is truly terrible at times, and the plot devices and logical inconsistencies are off the charts. The film is over-edited and has big problems finding its tonality. The humour is bland and cringey at times, but I guess activists aren't the most funny people around anyway. The more serious parts were actually the best parts of the film, but I'm afraid that doesn't really say much.Of course, Black Widow needed a female director. Wait, there are better candidates for the job? Nah, never mind, let's just take someone with no big budget experience at all. Fittingly, Black Widow feels like a commitee film where the director is just a stand-in on strings. At least they can signal their virtue with this truly fine example of the equity approach, I guess.And yet despite all this, I feel like there was a good film somewhere hidden in this mess. Maybe in an earlier draft of the script, maybe never, but I can't help liking Scarlett Johansson anyway. Still, I don't think I will ever pay to see a Marvel movie again.

Odd, eh?Are people still not rolling their eyes or has this become some form of weird Hollywood porn by now. All men - bad, weak or comedic relief. All wAhMen - strong, smart, ruthless yet oddly also compassionate when the script wants them to look good. This is pathetic. How many \"men are bad\" movies like this do you plan on doing? Pretty sure your target audience has died of Toxoplasmosis by now.Plus I never liked terrible cliches, bad russian dialects, and anti-men agendas, and even still I wanted this to be a good and successful movie because Black Widow had a lot of potential and was cool in the other movies.

It kinda breezes by as there aren't many dull moments thanks to the performances. Florence Pugh is quite good in the film as Yelena Belova. Personally I wasn't intrigued by the character in the comics and I didn't think much of her in the trailers, but after seeing the film she is quite the scene stealer and bounces off Scarlett Johansson very well. There's a hilarious moment where she mocks Natasha's superhero landing.Speaking of Scarlett she can play this role in her sleep. She carries the film very well and there's a nice feeling of passing the torch kind of feel. She's also surrounded by a nice supporting cast. Dave Harbor and Rachel Weisz bring a lot flare to their characters Red Guardian and Melina. I don't expect this, but as a fan of comics I wonder if Melina in particular will progress to be the more comic accurate version of the character.Now this is a spoiler review so I'm going to talk about Taskmaster. Personally, I kinda bought into the twist as the daughter of Ray Winstone's General Dreykov, who is totally mind controlled. I wasn't too bothered by it, but it's like a scratch that I couldn't inch because frankly speaking, Taskmaster isn't in the film often. More I think would have benefitted truthfully. I think for diehard Taskmaster fans they might consider this an IRON MAN 3 Mandarin kind of ordeal, BUT I felt that here at least they tried to do something unique about Taskmaster, where as the Mandarin in IRON MAN 3 was a complete joke for the shock of all things. She is portrayed by Olga Kurylenko and despite the very brief screen time, I felt she delivered her performance effectively.Action I thought was good, but nothing mind blowing. I did feel the third act could have been better. Maybe a longer fight between Natasha and Taskmaster or maybe longer fight scene while she's falling from the sky. What you see in the trailer is what you really get...nothing too exciting. It all kinda wrapped up neatly and while I appreciated all the mind control aspect of the film with chemical pheromones, at times it did feel like an easy way out.I appreciated the more serious tone in this film. I savor all the MCU films that disregard their formulaic humor for some more serious story-telling like the CAPTAIN AMERICA trilogy, the first IRON MAN and INFINITY WAR. Not to say that they can't do humor right as the first GUARDIANS and the first AVENGERS handle it perfectly. HOWEVER, I think they could have pushed the boundary with the serious stuff a little more. Like really dive into the fact that these Widows are kidnapped at a young age in light of human trafficking or the fact that all the Widows are sterile.Overall, in cinematic terms, it's a good start to Phase 4.

A total and utter mess.In the 1996 parts, they actually had kids wearing TOMs espadrilles, a company that didn't start until 2006. Then they had Natasha dressed like an SJW from 2017. In a Russian prison, yes, Russian, they of course had to add the obligatory diverse cast of black gay guys because we know Russia is filled with black gay guys. Of course, all the assassins were females, because why not? Remember, men are bad. Write that down.It was 5 min of data dump expositions, then 5 minutes of action/fighting, then back to 5 min of data dump expositions then back to action/fighting. And that was the whole movie.Try figuring out the plot because I couldn't after an hour. It was literally just random scenes, phony obligatory fight scenes, and cute one-liners, repartee, and expositions. You know, the regular Hollywood formula that the zombies eat up.One sister had an accent, the other one didn't. No explanation. Nor was there an explanation why they had superhuman powers. At least with Superman it's explained. There were scenes where someone shot 20 bullets into the car and none of them got hit. They even had multiple soldiers shoot 50 bullets into a helicopter and of course, she didn't get hit. Remember the people shooting were trained soldiers but shot like blind people.I'm all for fun goofy action, but there is a limit to my suspension of disbelief. The jokes were unfunny and cringeworthy.David Harbour and Rachel Weisz didn't have accents in the beginning of the movie, but then later did. So they developed accents over the years? David could hardly keep a consistent bad Russian accent. Literally, NOTHING made any sense.It started without providing you any information about why they had to leave, why someone was chasing them etc. And in the heat of every intense moment, the girls stayed totally calm and exchanged one-liner jabs. Pure Hollywood candy.I have never seen so many diverse cast members jammed into one film, not because it made sense, but because filmmakers now have to meet the Academy quotas for some arbitrary diversity standard. Not based on merit, personality, skills, or art, but on gender and race, the least interesting thing about people.And let us not forget about the new obligatory casting of non-Americans because it's not like American actors want or need to work. Probably 60% or more of the cast are foreigners.Why were the sisters fighting when they met? Well, why not. Nothing makes any sense in movies anymore. This is about making a ton of money.Scarlet phoned in her wooden performance, but everyone were pretty much bad.I am surprised they were able to use the word \"mother\" instead of the PC \"birthing person\" Even \"he\" \"she\" were used. But give it a few years and you won't be able to recognize any of the English language in movies anymore.For the love of God, SKIP THIS and stop funding these stupid movies."}, {"reviewer_name": "bilou-02331", "date": "10 July 2021", "text": "One of the worst story ever.

They even made the amour red white and blueReally was this the best you could come up with????Thew movie starts out fairly good, Some good fast paced action(Some of it a bit too over the top though)\nThey seem to wanna go down the same path ,as they've done with Fast And Furious. They make their heroes too over the top.Natasha takes a fall from a great height, and hit every thing she possibly can on the way down. Yet she she just stand up and walks it off.Here's the thing .Natasha DOESN'T have super powers. You can call her super hero all you like,but the truth is she is the weakest of the Avengers. With no super powers at all,she is the weak link.She can hold her own in hand to hand combat with Humans, But that is the basic of her strengthThe fight sequences aren't all bad.Some of them are pretty good. Whenever they dare using a wide shot. Instead of up close. (which is rare in the movie) But they also, rely to much on wire stunt. Which I think is a bad thing. Some of it work. But a lot of it just get to over the top.Sadly the movie also has to many \"look at me pauses\" when they're about to do some action.Hollywood should learn From Old Jackie Chan movie here.He usually just did the moves. Mostly his moves floated into each other. Hollywood always have these moments where they pause, so the heros strike a pose for the camera. And the enemy just stand around gaping in awe.Like whenever Natasha jumps and lands. She lands with one foot out to the side. This may look like cool action in the comix.

It's hard to get invested in their dysfunctional pseudo-family drama when the characters are constantly trying to goof around making silly jokes for the younger kids. I did enjoy Rachel Weisz's acting though, her accent and overall presence in the frame were solid. Harbour was absolutely wasted, his character is only annoying. The two \"sisters\" barely have any dynamic and mostly feel like old friends from college all grown up trying to make it look like they are still friends 10 years after graduation.What also didn't make sense was the scale of the action scenes. When I'm watching the Avengers I am ok with godlike creatures like Thor or a super-strong Hulk taking huge amounts of damage and feeling all good in the next scene. But this is Natasha Romanoff, the Black Widow, she would've actually died in the first like 30 minutes of the film. The \"sisters\" also look and act not like superheroes, and not like secretly highly trained operatives. They never look menacing or professional. They just look like your average girls doing a cosplay party. It's not even about their physique (although the first half of the film really banks on \"rear-back\" shots of Scarlett Johansson), it's about their movement, speed, and technique. Just watch how Keanu Reeves moves in John Wick and compare it to this one.This whole Red Room thing is weird. Dreykov is boring and he looks like a generic middle-tier henchman, yet he hides in a flying super-fortress. His safety mechanism was just adopting some sort of DNA programming ripped straight from Demolition Man (1993). He's like a really bad James Bond villain, he gives away all his plans for no reason and cares too much about Romanoff. This Taskmaster guy turns out to be Olga Kurylenko, which is...just weird, but she can definitely handle playing someone with zero personality. I've read a lot of negative feedback about this one, but I'm not familiar with the source material so it didn't hurt me as much, he(she) was just a super-boring version of Ultron or something.I actually almost killed myself with laughter after the \"feromone block\" and \"sever the nerve\". This was probably the only good joke in the whole film, yet they took it seriously.There's also a weird subplot about magical dust that gives everyone back their personality, but it's not even worth talking about.Black Widow (2021) would've been an average superhero film if it was made in the early 2000s, but in 2021, and especially after Infinity War and Endgame...come on, guys.I'd love this to be different, a straight-up drama with bits of good action, or a full-on parody. This one tries to be lots of things at once, further made worse by directional inexperience which shows in every scene.I can't recommend this film to anyone, really.

There were more bloody dramatic superhero landings than good action sequences.The writing itself was cliche and ordinary and didn't enhance the film at all, the performances were fine, nothing particularly outstanding from any cast member. I thought the humour from Florence Pugh and David Harbour was a positive acting wise.The villains too.. oh god. Again with Marvel, villains like Thanos and Loki have partly made the MCU so enjoyable, but you couldn't get a more ordinary villain in this film if you tried. Just a power hungry Russian, wow creative. And Taskmaster too, who I don't know a lot about, but that character could have been used better.So the film was a huge let down for me.

OK, you will say, they had to have A-listed actors to play in a Marvel film, not Russians, but they had The Americans as a blueprint on how to make this work and they did not care. You do know that sleeper agents don't speak with an accent, right?And there was another issue, that of Florence Pugh stealing the show, even if her character was pretty inconsistent and not having her title the film. Faking a dull Balkan fatalism in everything she did, and with a deadpan sense of humor, she kind of showed us what probably Wanda should have behaved like. Finally, Olga Kurylenko. She got me excited with her character and being introduced in the Marvel universe. Yet in this film she had like one line of dialogue.

Which just screams The Americans (FX show) to me.The plot and direction were lazy, and could've focused on a much more character driven direction, exploring Natasha struggling between the family that never was and the demons of her past. Yet between the cheap MCU comedy (I hope you're sitting up straight Natasha), the overuse of CGI in what's become known as the predictable Marvel movie climatic ending, the terrible use of a character with SO much potential in Taskmaster, the all to many coincidences (parachute just being in front of Natasha when Yelena blows up the planes engine to name one) and Ray Winston as a cockney Russian who severely, severely underwhelmed, it feels like an attempted money grab from Kevin Feige and co which lures us in for one last glimpse of Scarlett Johansen as Natasha Romaoff just to introduce a couple of new characters who we'll undoubtedly see somewhere down the line (yawn). But as long as they make their profit, who cares if the story is actually good, right?This could've been the ultimate Marvel spy movie, and at is core would've been a family reconnecting to take down the machine that created them. Instead, we got a bad James Bond of the 70's spoof which will ultimately go down in MCU history alongside the first two Thor films and 2008's The Incredible Hulk as films that are just kind of...there.If this film came out after Civil War, there could've been some salvation. However, as an audience ultimately knowing Natasha's fate, this film serves no purpose being released in 2021 other then the ones I stated earlier ($$$ & Florence Pugh) and doesn't affect the timeline whatsoever and could've easily not have been released.I just can't escape the feeling that they should've done more for Scarlett Johansen in her way to late origin story of a character she's been playing for over a decade. The correct idea could've been to give the Black Widow a phase 4 series like The Falcon & The Winter Solider and perhaps make Loki his own genre bending film, which would've been so much more captivating.

We'll never know, but then again, I came too see a movie about the Black Widow, not the dollar store Russian knock-off Avengers.The Red Room, where other Black Widows are trained, along with the Taskmaster and the villain who created them, could've been so much more interesting, but they're just plot devices used to show us more of the MCU bad fake-Russian accent, action Hero Simpsons episode.I was hoping to see Black Widow, the elite lone assassin, with a story reminiscient of La Femme Nikita. Instead I got this goofy family comedy from Disney. If you stay for the post-credit scene, you'll realize this whole thing is a setup for the upcoming Hawkeye series on Disney Plus.In other words, the reason Pugh gets so much screen time, and the \"kid sister\" gets so much dialogue, is because this whole movie was an advertisement for another show.ScarJo and Natasaha Romanoff deserved better."}, {"reviewer_name": "rskolek", "date": "10 July 2021", "text": "I dont expect much from Marvel movies, I just want to be entertained.

Now we have settled the intelligent female and the muscles male, which later on we will find out that she was responsible for improving a technology that controlled the Widows and he was the Crimson Dynamo - my bad, Alexei, Red Guardian -, the Soviet Super Soldier.As they escape, did anyone else find odd that a 6-years-old's song was a 70's song about running away? It felt forced to suit the moment, specially from parents that lived by a different ideology, how was she shown a 70's song? Something else that bothered me was Melina being shot and now Natasha is supposed to pilot the plane, she is even able to take off with the plane despite how hard the yoke is.Then we follow Yelena, still under the effects of that drug, to catch someone, they start to fight in the middle of the street after the target is ran over. We get to see there are people on that street and they simply acted like there wasn't a fight going on? That there was a body lying on the ground?Natasha was living in a trailer and there we get two buutshots in different segments from Natasha, one would think that with a female director we wouldn't see this kind of sexist shots, or they aren't sexist when shot by a female director?After we see Natasha and Yelena's first reunion in decades, they are on a standoff and what better way to show that they are bad ass spies than having them disarm the other and equip their gun? It is just the most overused move in action films with spies. They get a truce after throwing some fists and Natasha asks Yelena what are those vials to which she replies something like \"did you bring that back here?\" hmm... excuse me? Natasha doesn't know what that is about, she probably didn't even know her \"sister\" was alive and Yelena throws yet another cliche? Come on, writers, you can do better than that. By the way, what's up with Yelena's heavy Russian accent? Russian spies were taught to speak without any hint of accent so why does she?Still in Yelena's place there is an editing mistake that you wouldn't expect from Disney,we get the Red Room spies blowing up Yelena's flat's roof, and we see two dropping from the hole., Yelena moves forward to grab those vials, but she reacts two the other two spies coming from the door but were closer to Natasha, then back at Yelena the spies finally drop to the floor.We have some moments when Yelena acts too meta when she says how Natasha always does a pose when she lands to the ground or when Natasha is about to tell her something and Yelena replies \"you're about to give me a super hero's speech\", making for of the landing pose I found it alright, but the \"super hero speech\" why writers, why must you be so cringe?There is also the secrecy of the Red Room, which nobody knows where it is and they felt like they have to enforce that some 5 or 6 times, we get it, it is secret, stop repeating.When Yelena mocks Natasha's landing pose, she makes some weird old people noises, she does the same noise when she climbing a flight of stairs to get in the helicopter, is Yelena a granny? Why does she sound like that?Later one, we finally see the antagonist of the film, too late if you ask me, still he goes on about his plan, how actual power lies in the dark, still he suffers from the I-have-to-tell-you-my-plan syndrome and as you can guess it backfires on him, specially when someone that controls a super secret organization is so easily taunted by Natasha. I'm starting to think Disney saved the money on the writers to pay for Scarlett's wage, how can writers make so many mistakes?In the end, we see Natasha taking on like 20 Widows, I get Natasha fighting 20 minions in other films, but aren't Widows supposed to be super spies or something? How can Natasha take so many of them at the same time?I'm done with my notes, worthwhile moments are the comedic and family ones, they are alright, nothing great, but in such a mediocre film you got cling to what you find good. Also, I was a disappointed with the Taskmaster, I thought its role would have been way more important considering the first, and only, trailer I saw. On the same lines, some things aren't explained like, how does Dreykov and his daughter survive such explosion? How was Yelena and Natasha assigned to be the daughters? Why didn't we get nothing from Natasha's \"training\" on the Red Room besides those weird flashes? The film felt lacking, it could have been so much more, so much better.

It looks pretty on the outside, following the tone of the entire MCU, but it doesn't work, because the spark to turn it on isn't useful enough.If we look at it from the perspective of the entire saga, it doesn't contribute anything that could not have been justified in a brief scene from another future canon film. The main character's arc is unaffected at all, it doesn't sort out loose ends from chronologically subsequent movies (if there are any), and it doesn't focus on Nat's real origin, other than a couple of conversations. They could have included tons of different cameos, or introduced iconic characters for the rest of the series, but sadly none of that is here (and don't make up tales saying that Valentina Allegra de Fontaine will be iconic).If we see it from the particular perspective, as an isolated product, it does not work either.

However one may feel about Scarlett Johansson as an actress, there's no denying she's been in the MCU longer than most (if there's one 'good' thing about IM2, it's that it introduced this awesome character). She's done the hard yards and the fact that it's taken until now to get her well-deserved solo film isn't her fault (blame the higher-ups). While some dismissed her as 'not special' because she didn't possess super powers, she's proven her detractors wrong by enduring for so long.Johansson isn't given the credit she deserves for bringing such a complex character to life. Natasha is someone with some real demons in her past and she's done everything humanly possible to make up for her mistakes (unlike certain other so-called 'superheroes'). When the movie starts, we're in 1995 with young Natasha (Ever Anderson, who does a great job of not just looking like a young version of Scarlett Johansson, but also conveying so much for such a young actress) and her adoptive sister, Yelena (Violet McGraw, also doing a fine job for one so young), who're both capable of doing the 'spider walk' from The Exorcist. While those with short attention spans may find the opening 'boring', to those who aren't so easily bored, it's important for the movie to establish this sibling relationship, as this movie all about family.When the sisters are whisked away in an exciting airplane sequence and then separated, you really *feel* it, as young Natasha has shown her utter devotion to Yelena, willing to take on anyone to keep her safe. It's then that we're treated to probably one of the best montages in a comic book film that I can think of in recent memory, involving chilling images set to an unsettling version of 'Smells Like Teen Spirit'. It immediately sets the mood for the rest of the film, which is actually a lot more brutal when it comes to the fights/kills than we've seen before in the MCU, and lets you know this will be a more 'mature' film. That's not to say there isn't some humour sprinkled throughout. It's there, but not overdone, and when the laughs do come, they're all the more effective *because* there hasn't been constant wisecracking (the biggest laugh had to be Yelena bringing up Natasha's superhero pose that she does and then acting it out).The best thing this movie did was casting Florence Pugh as grown-up Yelena, as she plays exceptionally well off Johansson and their onscreen chemistry makes for a believable sibling relationship. Their fight, after being reunited, is one of the film's best scenes, but the quieter heart-to-heart talks they have are equally important, as is their complicated relationships with their adoptive parents, Melina (Rachel Weisz) and Alexei (David Harbour), who bring different dynamics and add even more depth. 'Dysfunctional' doesn't begin to describe this family, but when it counts, they're there for each other. It's a shame that we'll likely never see all four together again, as their interaction proved quite compelling.On the side of the bad guys, there's the masked 'Taskmaster' who can mimic the Avengers fighting styles, hence why we see the use of a shield and bow/arrows among other fighting moves. Whilst able to hold her own, the first face-off between Taskmaster and Natasha shows that she's not some unbeatable 'perfect' fighter, but she uses her smarts and her brains over brawn is what sets her apart from all the characters that rely on muscle. If there's one letdown in the film, it's Ray Winstone's Dreykov, but it's kind of worth him being so pathetic a human being just to see Natasha outsmart him and smiling more than I think we've ever seen her smile before.This is a more 'intimate' MCU film, and as such the climax may not be quite what some were expecting/hoping for, but it's still satisfying because of what it means for Natasha, Yelena and all the other Widows. As for any 'unbelievable' elements in the film...at this point, if you're willing to accept things like helicarriers and talking raccoons/trees, then having a problem with the 'fantastical' elements here seems a bit hypocritical. It's not just the acting, action, humour, and music that the film has going for it, but also the way it *looks*. Cate Shortland should be commended for her directing, as there are some truly great/beautiful shots throughout, the fights are never confusing and the effects on display are used sparingly, but really well. All three lead actresses look smashing in their costumes (Scarlett proves that whether she's wearing black or white, she looks good in ANYTHING). David Harbour? Not so much.While some believe 'it's all downhill' after Endgame, I personally feel it's actually the opposite. With a certain character no longer hogging all the focus/screentime, we can now focus on other characters who deserve to have their stories told. This is one such instance. The main disappointment is that this is, for all intents and purposes, Scarlett Johansson's/Natasha Romanoff's swansong. While I would've liked to have seen more films with the sisters together, at least ScarJo can rest assured that the mantle of Black Widow will be in safe hands with Florence Pugh (assuming, of course, she takes over the role, though they'd be foolish not to see what a stand-out she was here and feature her in future MCU projects. The post-credits scene suggests she will be, but the conflict it sets up could be resolved with a simple conversation between her character and the target she's sent after). So long, Natasha. Thanks for all the crotch-throat grabs. Fade to black, Widow."}, {"reviewer_name": "tbyrne-70417", "date": "8 July 2021", "text": "Reviews not appearing?

Florence Pugh could not have glided into the Marvel Cinematic Universe any smoother. Her light-hearted and comedic personality was the perfect fit for the tone of the film. It wasn't cheesy comedy which I loved, sometimes Marvel can be a bit too cheesy for me. Her best moment is when she lands in the superhero pose, after making fun of Natasha for it, and gets completely disgusted with herself.Personally, I would have liked to see a bit more of Natasha's back story; how she escaped the Red Room or how Nick Fury recruited her.I am so happy to see Natasha have this film for herself.When Yelena visited her grave at the end of the film, and did their whistle call, I thought for sure that we would hear the reply of the whistle and Natasha would still be alive.

Nothing special or memorable about him, except he has some weird body odor:)))\n-The idea that there are 1000s of assassins like Black Widow in the world (yes, 1000s) that are active in the present and have been active all this time kinda takes away from the character in my opinion. And even the other widows (also, small question, if all assassins are named \"widows\", and Natasha broke from the organization, why would she keep it in her name?) start to look the same, there is nothing memorable about any of them.-The whole movie felt like a side quest in between the actual story.

I really liked Black Widow throughout the MCU, and Wintersoldier was probably the best film featuring her, but this feels like it's trying very hard to make a social point rather than tell a truly compelling story featuring larger than life super soldiers. My absolute favourite part was David Harbour. His role is relatively small but it was fascinating. I think it was a huge misopportunity to give him a bigger role, so he could really show off his strengths.One glaring problem of this movie was humour. Almost all of its humour was misplaced and eye rolling.I wonder if the story might actually be good, but needed to be told by a director who knew how it should be told.If you're an MCU fan, don't watch this movie.

I'm gonna go into spoilers near the end but I will issue a warning beforehand. First off, the good. This movie starts very well. One of the best for a Marvel film, though I think Civil War or Winter Soldier is the best for Marvel opening scenes. The acting is pretty good, especially Florence Pugh and Scarlett Johansson, who are both excellent. The relationship between Natasha and her sister is written quite well... and that's where my positivity ends. Every other aspect of this movie is so bad that I'm truly surprised. Time for spoilers.The story for this movie has to be straight up one of the worst for any superhero film ever. The idea is that there's an antidote that can snap Black Widows back to reality if they inhale it. This is ridiculous. 20+ years of conditioning can all be undone by inhaling a weird red gas? Natasha has to stop the guy who is the head of the Black Widow program and free all of the Black Widows. Oh boy. How utterly boring.I could forgive the bad plot of the action was good but it's not. It's not even mediocre. The action is some of the worst I've seen. It's so shakey and choppy and even the choreography is lazy and boring. The best fight is between Natasha and her sister as it has the best choreography, but it doesn't make up for the god awful editing.The worst thing about the movie is how there is zero tension. We know Black Widow can't die because this takes place before Endgame, so we never feel like she's in danger. Although they could have at least tried! Show her struggling to get up with cuts and bruises after a bad fall or something. Instead she does things that would kill any human being and walks off without a scratch. Because of this she feels invincible throughout the whole movie and it becomes hard to feel anything for her.Lastly, the villain. Taskmaster is, without question, the worst villain in any MCU film. For one she (that's right, I said she) never speaks. You know how Taskmaster is egotistical and prideful? Not on this one. Here, she's mute. They also made her a girl for no reason. Like, it makes sense in the context of the story why she's a girl, but the story is already terrible so whatever. A better plot would have written an interesting villain instead of gender swapping the character and giving a half assed emotional arc to her.Captain America: Winter Soldier is a better Black Widow movie than this.

Now she finally gets her own movie, a chance to fill in and fill out the details that have been teased at. But what we get is a rushed, poorly directed, poorly written afterthought.It starts with a decent, but rushed opening a la THE AMERICANS. But if only there were one more scene with the girls interacting, one more scene with Red Guardian being a goofy dad, and all of them having fun, but it's over too quickly. (Also, were young teens really dying their hair blue in the '90s?)Then, during the opening credits, we get a mishmash of quick cuts -- when we should have seen how cruel the Red Room was. So there's no real depth to the pain they talk about. It's all told not shown.Then the plot starts, Natasha is called to action by her \"sister.\" Johansson seems a little tired of the role now, and Florence Pugh brings some energy and handles the quippy MCU banter well. Although her size makes her fight scenes hard to believe. Also, in scene after scene, these two get in car crashes, fall off buildings, get thrown around, and receive what should be lethal injuries -- and they just walk away! The movie tries to nod to this by showing Natasha with bruises and needing Advil -- but it's a copout. The most interesting thing about BW is that she's human, highly trained, but human. So she should fight with her training and her wits -- because she needs to avoid serious injury. She should be having more Bourne-like action scenes, not being tossed around like Thor.For the rest: some forced family drama (which, again, could have used one or two more beats), and Taskmaster is change from an annoying comic character into a twist we've seen a thousand times before. (It brackets the narrative, which is something screenwriters are taught to do, but it was unexciting and sloppily handled).

But if you wanted to see how a Fast and Furious-esque movie from MCU would look like, you would have wonderful time. They open the movie strong by letting us know what's like to be in the Red Room. We get to see a glimpse of happiness these girls had in their life before they were turned into deadly assassins. Action is a major part of this movie and they sure have it in plenty. Those scenes are really fun and entertaining but a lot of it suffers from poor editing. Editing in general is not the strongest aspect of this movie. The visuals effects and cinematography were top-notch as expected from a marvel flick. The score and song choices were also nice.The cast, lead by Scarlett Johansson, does quite a good job with what she was given. Natasha Romanoff shines really well, especially in the silent moments.Among the new additions, Florence Pugh stands out the most. She is perfect as Yelena Belova and by the end of the movie, you'll really care about her and the journey she is about to embark in the MCU. O-T Fegbenle's Rick Mason is not a character you'd expect much from but he was really fun. His scenes with Natasha were one of the better parts of this movie. David Harbour was having fun with character but I'd have loved to see him do some serious stuff or get involved in a cool fight scene. Rachel Weisz was good. However one of the major disappointment that has to do with this movie is the villain(s). I thought Taskmaster was utterly wasted here. The character was so menacing and threatening that it could be the main villain of the movie but it wasn't exploited to its fullest potential and ultimately ruined the character with what could say a lame reveal or twist. Dreykov Is one-dimensional and pose no threat. The movie ends on a high note in the third act. The high octane high scale action sequence sprinkled with some genuinely good character moments really sealed the job.On the whole, BW is a grand action adventure movie that tells us more about Natasha. Besides her story, there was sibling rivalry and family humour."}, {"reviewer_name": "thedsgeek", "date": "10 July 2021", "text": "Seeing black widow in avengers, fighting aliens and superhumans never made sense to me since she is a glorified spy, like james bond but with better martial arts skills. But when marvel announced this movie, I was curious to see black widow in her own domain, but In the movie she could be thor himself. I mean she falls off from 4th floor hitting evry pipe and vent on the way down very brutally and still manages to land on her feet. I mean whaaaaaaaat? Really? And that's not just one scene, she is indestructible in literally all the fighting scenes to the point it doesn't even make sense for her to be qualified as human.Anyways, moving on to the villain, what a pathetic... And i mean really pathetic portrayal of the main villain. This man supposedly controlling the entire world is just an old man with temper issues? Really? Where is the intimidation? My grandmother was more brutal than this so called \"villain\".And don't even get me started on Taskmaster. ANOTHER GENDER SWAP, Marvel and Disney are hell bent on ruining the existing characters. How difficult is it to use existing female characters or even create new ones? But nooooo ooooooo.... Female empowerment cannot be done without snatching something from males. They could have just left the identity hidden and used taskmaster in other marvel movies as well. Pathetic.Action itself was supposed to be subtle, but they made it downright an avenger movie.

The writers needed a little more imagination; the concept was there, but the execution wasn't as good as it could've been. Had it been trimmed down to 90-100 mins, I may have enjoyed it more. It also had lame attempts at humor - probably the worst of all MCU films, and it's not like there weren't opportunities to throw in some comic relief.

But after a day of thinking on it I figured out it wasn't just the bad cgi and disappointing storyline.Let's start with the positive: Florence Pugh she was great! She was real, you saw raw emotion. I just loved her in the movie but too bad it was this horrid movie! My two stars are for her only!The rest well for the rest I made a list of what I hated about this movie, let me say I'm not a huge marvel fan but some I do like. I was very excited to hear the mysterious backstory of black widow after all this time. Which brings me to the first thing I didn't like.1. I was hoping this movie would fill in missing backstory of black widow. Learn more about the red room, her training, what she did before she shows up at starks. But no this movie takes place after civil war - boo! Don't care what she did those two years just wanted to know her origin story! What a waste of a movie2. Bad CGI -movies from 1998 looked better. We didn't go here to watch a cartoon! Bad job Marvel/Disney cutting corners and money saving for cgi doesn't make a good action movie3. The red room- ummm so it went from an elaborate Russian brainwashing institute for trained killers that were taken as babies with genetic potential that was believable sci-fi to unbelievable floating satellite with robotic mind controlled human trafficked girls stolen from all over the world -for what reason? We don't know? His main reasoning there are just too many girls?? What about Soviet plans or something for the reason we are still training? What are we training them for now? I thought this was going to be more like agent carter and dotty and the red room but no they had to ruin the elaborate story line for a more unbelievable bigger then life one.4. Black widow- if she wasn't miraculously living through falls from the sky or explosions she was just sitting there saying nothing and doing nothing! She didn't even use her intelligent spy brain she is supposed to have, no her little sister has to take control and tell her how to fight and survive and plan ummm what?!?5. So many plot holes and storyline weirdness and costume mistakes-\nWhat girl had blue hair in 1995 or what mom wore skinny jean ankle pants and converses? Why were they really in Ohio did we cover that, just to steal more girls for the red room? Why did her and her sister fight upon meeting each other? They said she was trained different then her so probably didn't fight each other in the red room and hadn't seen each other since then? Who is the random guy always bringing black widow planes? Like we are going to believe that those girls have any feelings for those fake parents- I mean maybe the little one since she was young but Natasha knew they weren't her parents she had already been in the red room why would she even have an emotional bound to them at all she should hate them as much as drakov for bringing her back and taking her \"sister\" she ended up caring about? The girls fighting Yelena at the beginning when black widow shows up why didn't she just sprinkle some magic fairy Antidote on them like she did to you know everyone else at the end of the movie? If breaking your nose would of killed the fermion block to hurt drakov why didn't anyone do that before that wasn't mind controlled? Why didn't the genetically enhanced red guardian just sit around in prison when he clearly could of broke through the walls-he needed two women to fly around in a helicopter doing nothing to help him? There are so many more but...All in all I'm just getting annoyed thinking about the movie all over again now. What a waste! They had so much they could of chose to do but chose this- writers should be fired over this one and Disney needs to get out of the sci-fi business!

Taking place after Civil War, Natasha and her spy family try bring down the man responsible for creating the Widow program which controls orphaned girls into becoming killing machines. The film has a sick intro, a balanced start and a jam packed ending that feels rushed and somewhat anti climactic by the MCU standards making it all feel exactly like a second rate story about a second rate hero that came out 5 years too late.What often triggers me in Hollywood movies is when they poorly try to fit two languages into the plot which ends up being ridiculous. The mysterious language they were attempting to speak would be something close to how a 2 year old infant or a 95 year old toothless grandma would speak Russian because I couldn't understand a single word. If the film insists on creating this international spy vibe, the actors should at least put some effort into it. It kills the atmosphere and makes the movie look amateur when someone says a sentence in Russian and gets an English reply, or when the words on screens are bilingual.On top of this, we get huge inconsistencies in the narrative that jumps all over the place. The excessive action would suggest that we are watching a Captain America film because Natasha is clearly on some super serum based on how she falls from buildings and gets thrown all over the place. They could have gone for a slick spy-thriller style that would have used her agility, marksmanship and stealth but instead it was boom bang boom.I didn't hate the film but it all felt simply meh for a superhero flick. David Harbor was my favorite character as he was organic, honest and provided a few laughs. Florence Pugh did a fine job as well but Scarlett herself was flat and forgettable. The film had interesting villains but in the classical Marvel fashion, they got about 2 minutes of development.

The CGI and action sequences are so dumb it will transport you back to 1994 when the fire and explosions looked like ps1 graphics. I am still in disbelief that this movie was made in 2021... they need to drop the studio who did this movie. Forever. It was distracting me from what was on screen.And to add to that, the characters were making it through absolutely unlivable situations. Huge explosions right next to Black Widow or Florence Pugh and they just do a backflip, or run through the fire. It was like those old garbage Delta Force movies.

Except I'm not the one that's on the cover of a magazine. I'm not the killer little girls call their hero.\"Finally, it has come. The MCU's newest addition Black Widow has Natasha Romanoff confronting the darker parts of her ledger when a dangerous conspiracy with ties to her past arises. Pursued by a force that will stop at nothing to bring her down, Natasha must deal with her history as a spy and the broken relationships left in her wake long before she became an Avenger. This isn't necessarily an origin story or prequel. It's an interquel right after the events of Civil War and before Infinity War. Why Marvel decided for this to be the movie for phase 4? The world will never know. It's a mistake that I will hold for the rest of their days. This isn't by any means a bad movie, I'm just disappointed that it took so long to get a Black Widow movie, and now that everything has built up to it, we got this final product. Black Widow is good, but not great. And part of the issue was waiting too long. The writers on this one weren't all experienced Marvel writers except for one who did Thor: Ragnarok and helped with continuity with a few more. This branched away from the classic fantasy element we're used to, but managed to fall back into place of predictability. Most of the story is how you'd expect it to play out, especially in the ladder half. All of the family aspect is strong. There's a sense of character and place when all of them are together. As usual, the acting is great. For it being a Black Widow movie, though, Florence Pugh steals the whole thing. She's one, if not, my favorite recent actress to make a mark, so some might think I'm bias. But Yelena is such a great character and she makes the most out of it. Almost all of the character development went to her since we've already got a good portrait from Natasha at this point. David Harbour is also eccentric and funny as Alexei. Those two have some of the funniest scenes.Marvel has gotten better with comedic timing and jokes, mainly after Guardians. All of them land here. Even though the story may not be the most compelling of the universe, there's that classic charm to it that makes it a solid action flick. The action scenes don't disappoint and are full of fight scenes out of a spy movie. The VFX may not be the best, and that might be because they have bigger projects coming up, but it does the job. Many aspects of this are good, but just not quite up to par, and I don't mean to complain or anything. Had some changes been made, this could've been great. I guess my main problem comes from some of the writing, throw-awayable villains, and third act. The third act, once again, took an easy route. Once we get to where we need, everything was simplified into something we've seen before. When it comes to the villains, the main one is an evil man which obviously doesn't do a whole lot. Taskmaster could've been a good one with a little more development, but there wasn't enough time with them. The conclusion is just another fun action movie and nothing more. (Side note: I hated the title sequence for this and I don't think I'm the only one). Marvel has been on a roll with the past few additions, and maybe my expectations were too high. The family aspect and delving into family history works well in its favor. Maybe with more thought in the story, this wouldn't be underwhelming. Let me reiterate, I did enjoy Black Widow. It's easier to pick out problems with where my expectations were at. Right now it sits in the middle of my MCU additions ranked. If you liked it, good for you. If you didn't, I can completely understand. More than two watched might be needed for this one, but I'll enjoy it for now."}, {"reviewer_name": "jacoblawrence-19058", "date": "18 July 2021", "text": "Good action sequences? Check.

Most of the film felt like a low-end superhero show and the actors looked like they were all bored to death.The plot in the film was basically just like any other superhero show, bad guy gets un-brainwashed, sends message to old buddies/family, they work through their differences, get together and end up throwing some sort of explosive device in the last possible second to the bad guys and that's it. Characters end up in the rubble and say goodbye to each other and part ways. The only difference in this movie was that the characters were mainly women, but that's about it. We didn't even get to see Red Guardian at his full potential and taking any fight seriously as he did in the comics.We didn't even get to see Red Guardian's shield, which many of us expected to see as he is Russia's Captain America. Taskmaster wasn't even a hard villain to beat and all comic fans know that Taskmaster is a damn-near impossible to kill bad guy. I mean Taskmaster literally knows how to fights just like Captain America, Black Panther, Spider-Man, you name it. And for Nat to just beat her like that? Also the fact that all widows are trained exactly like Black Widow and are unable to beat her altogether in a scene, is sad. Not that I wanna see her beat, it's just that it doesn't make logical sense and Natasha should've not been able to survive more than a few seconds in that office on her own. It shows that just like many low-end superhero movies and TV shows, the main character is always outclassed to the point where they're stronger, faster, lighter, and more agile than the people that literally trained with them. Taskmaster's costume also sucked, nothing compared to comics Taskmaster. I was honestly expecting so much more out of taskmaster and now that character is ruined in the MCU forever.

The only character with any kind of development was David Harbour, but when your comic relief is a better thought out character and has more charisma than your lead then you have a problem.There was no drama or any sense of risk in the film, not only do you not care about the characters but you know whatever happens to them physically they'll just get back up and carry on. The action set pieces were fine but at times the editing didn't seem to make sense and characters started to do something and then in the next shot they are back where they were before. It all felt a bit slap dash and half hearted. In a sea of bad Russian accents though Ray Winstone does shine and deserves special mention.There is nothing even remotely original here, overall it feels like a knock off Marvel movie with better effects.

The story is quite interesting and apart from Johansson's character, it also revolves around others that we will see in the future.This is not the traditional origin film, as the action takes place over several time periods, but on the other hand, it fills all the gaps and gives us the information we have needed for years.All the actors are great in their roles, but Florence Pugh and Scarlett Johansson stand out, mainly because of their relationship. There are a lot of emotional moments and honestly if the film had been released at the beginning of MCU, the effect would not be as strong as it is now, because over the years Natasha has become an important figure in this universe.Most of the dialogues are really strong meaningful, so you can realize, that over the years Natasha has become one of our favorite characters.The action is done with taste and you can realize by watching the fight choreography. There are several scenes between Natasha and Taskmaster, which are pure pleasure for the eye, although the Taskmaster story could be better.I hope that every true MCU fan will appreciate the movie in the right way - in the cinema.

This is set right after civil war and ends right before infinity war.

Starring Scarlett Johannson in the lead role, alongside Florence Pugh, David Harbour, and Rachel Weisz, it establishes some previously desired backstory for the original female Avenger while setting things in motion for the future of the MCU.Sometime after the events of \"Captain America: Civil War\", Natasha \"Nat\" Romanoff/Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson), still on the run from the US government, is living in a safehouse in Norway. Shortly after receiving a package containing a strange red substance, Nat is attacked by a powerful figure known as the Taskmaster, whom she eventually manages to subdue and make her escape. Nat soon learns that the substance was sent by Yelena Belova (Florence Pugh), a fellow assassin raised as her surrogate younger sister, and decides to seek her out for further information. Later in Budapest, Nat and Yelena reunite after decades of estrangement where they discover they are now being pursued by unknown forces that will stop at nothing to wipe them out.It has taken quite a while, eleven years to be precise, for a solo movie to be made about the lone female member of the original six Avengers. In that time, the Black Widow character, or Nat as she's better known, has appeared in many other MCU films, working alongside Steve Rogers/Captain America in \"Captain America: The Winter Soldier\" and later going against him by siding with Tony Stark/Iron Man in \"Captain America: Civil War\". After so many films where she is relegated to a supporting role, she finally makes her debut as the main character in \"Black Widow\" and proves she can successfully stand on her own without the help of her fellow heroes.I've always wanted to know more about Nat's character, as she always seemed so shrouded in mystery about her past and why she even decided to join the Avengers in the first place. Aside from a brief hallucination scene in \"Avengers: Age Of Ultron\", little else has been divulged about her upbringing. In this film, we not only learn about Nat's home life as a child, but also the reasons why she defected from her Russian roots to become one of Earth's mightiest heroes. We also see how corruption runs deep within the organisations she was loyal to, similar to Hydra's infiltration of S. H. I. E. L. D back in \"The Winter Soldier\". Though the film didn't cover everything I would have liked to see, it does fill in enough blanks to hold me over until a possible sequel or even a future TV series can pick up where it left off.As is often the case with Marvel movies, we are presented with the usual high standard of explosive action sequences and scenes of hand-to-hand combat. However, rather than throw us into the thick of it right away, director Cate Shortland instead uses most of the film's first act to develop Nat as a character, helping us to better understand why it's so important that she gets to the bottom of what is happening all around her. As a result of this, the film does feel a bit slow near the beginning, but it's all worth sitting through for the exciting car chases through Budapest, the shootouts in various different buildings, and a creative helicopter rescue scene that ends on a humorous note. These are later punctuated with meaningful conversations between the characters discussing their insecurities and failures, which helps us to empathise with them. Considering Nat is one of the few Avengers without any proper superpowers or signature weapons, it is necessary for us to be reminded of her vulnerability and that deep down, she is still a regular human being.Scarlett Johansson gives it her all in the role she has gone on record stating is her all-time favourite. She does a great job depicting Nat as a more emotionally motivated character, acting on her own personal instincts rather than as a mindless drone merely doing what she is told. I really liked her interactions with Florence Pugh as Yelena, who is about on the same level as her in terms of combat skills. These two really did feel as though they had a history together and that familial bond they shared made their scenes more believable. David Harbour and Rachel Weisz, although not as prominent in the film as I had hoped, were also a nice addition to the cast as Nat and Yelena's surrogate parents Alexei and Milena. Harbour provides some comic relief reminiscent of his character Hopper in \"Stranger Things\" while Weisz loses herself in the role of both a maternal guardian and an elusive undercover spy.As we see the MCU move beyond the Infinity Saga, it is inevitable there will be even more stories to be told and even more heroes to be introduced. In spite of that, it is comforting to know that one of the most underrated members of the original six was still able to have her much deserved time in the spotlight. With the \" \"Hawkeye\" miniseries not far off, it seems that all of the old Avengers will finally have had an opportunity to shine on their own before the torch is eventually passed on to a brand new team. The seeds for the rest of Phase Four have now been sown and I greatly look forward to what future prospects the MCU has in store for us.I rate it 8/10."}, {"reviewer_name": "andymaranam", "date": "9 July 2021", "text": "My two favourite girls are on the big screen together and man was it worth the wait.

It's another movie with a villain who wants to take over the world. While I was watching this in the cinema I kept asking myself, \"should this movie be set after Civil War\"? I kept imagining this movie taking place after Infinity War; Thanos has just wiped out half of all life on Earth, and maybe this could push Natasha into finally tracking down the only family she had before the Avengers. One of this movies muddled and not fully realised themes is \"family\". I really liked David Harbour and Rachel Weisz as Natasha's 'parents' in this movie, I just wished the movie could've truly buckled down and had some serious moments; moments that don't instantly get interrupted with jokes. Why does Marvel keep doing that with serious moments in their movies? There was one scene (spoilers) after Harbour's character Alexei gets broken out of prison where Yelena explains her forced Hysterectomy, and I was a bit taken aback that it was played off as a comedic moment. That wasn't the case with Natasha and Bruce in Age of Ultron; this should have been a serious moment between Natasha and Yelena while talking to Alexei and Melina. I just wish some of the bigger implications and realities of being trained as an assassin for years since childhood were brought up between the four of them, but we never get that (wasted opportunities galore).One big problem I have with this movie is the brainwashing plot. It's just a cheap way to take away any agency or self responsibility from Natasha, her sister, and the other widows. The Black Widows are strictly trained killers, years and years of indoctrination from an early age, and have the movie explore Natasha struggle with that, and repenting for her crimes. But instead, no, she was just brainwashed.Another problem I had with the movie is that Natasha's basically Wonder Woman throughout the movie (durability wise, not character wise). There's an action scene right after she reunites with Yelena where she falls from a 4-5 story building, and she's hitting stuff on the way down, and she lands perfectly on her feet, no broken or sprained arms or legs, no cuts, not even a limp. She's obviously not gonna die in this movie but by god, could you also not make her a Mary Sue as well? Even Yelena gets a few cuts and bruises.My biggest problem with the movie overall though is that it's pointless filler; Black Widow's dead in the MCU now; does it matter what she did post-Civil War, pre-Infinity War? I like learning about her early life and I like knowing more about the Black Widow organisation she came from. Overall, I'm glad we got a Black Widow movie. What I'm not happy about is everything I've laid out in my review. I have no interest in ever watching it again. The only sliver of interest I got from the movie was Florence Pugh as Yelena; I would welcome her becoming the new Black Widow in any future MCU movies. I like that the post credit scene ties into the upcoming Hawkeye movie so I'm waiting for that at least.I'm giving this movie a 6 out of 10.

Yeah, Sure. Molina, the scientist/fake mom who has been working on Drakov's mind control system for YEARS of her professional life, suddenly has a change of heart out of nowhere by seeing a few pictures in an old album and some wishy-washy \"reunion\" and decides to work against Drakov.

Well, the feverish fans are. Instead of the usual endless chock a block CGI army battles the Avengers series suffers from, \"Black Widow\" concentrates more on back story, comedic touches and a healthy dose of James Bondish intrigue. Heck, they even pay proper homage by having Roger Moore as 007 on the telly in an opening sequence. Bravo!That means less cataclysmic explosions, and no destruction of civilizations. Less is more. Less destruction, but still plenty on a more psychological level, if you get the drift. We even have Ray Winstone as a deliciously sleazy Bond type villain, slurping his salacious world domination lines. Where's the white pussy? Black Widow is more acrobat and firearm expert than sheHulk, and thus the action has to be paired down to almost reasonable levels, where agility and smarts will win the day. Cool.Yet alas, this is Marvel, and thus there are issues. These are not really films, they are entertainment vehicles that fill a coupla hours with fantasy escapism. Accents come and go. Continuity seems like a costly premium. Bone crushing blows are quickly brushed off. Bad dudesses come crashing through the ceiling for no apparent reason other than it is super cool. This is action Hollywood damn it, do not question reason! You know the score. And yes, there is some crazy CGI explosive awesomeness for the comic book diehards. Thankfully \"Black Widow\" is entertaining enough to gloss over the silliness; it is quite easy to sit back with a giant bag of popcorn and eat it all up.Scarlett Johansson is excellent in the sexy (yet asexual), clever and self-effacing lead, martial arting her way through robotic foes (one at a time of course), and handling a motorbike through ridiculous traffic like, well, you know who.As a nice bonus David Harbour playing the bad father and failed super hero, threatens to steal the movie, but he is discretely inserted for just the right amount of kicks.

Actually, with a little rewriting, this could easily have come out an entire decade ago. Regardless of any other aspect, the fact that this stars a woman in the titular role has had people saying for years that it would automatically be bad. It's hard to argue that this would have come out upwards of 10 years ago, if not for that one aspect. I think a lot of people would have, and many, I'm sure, did, advise that it not rock the boat any more than that. So it's hard for me to overstate my relief and joy at finding that the movie is unapologetically feminist. It uses the spy training, which includes kidnapping girls when they are children, to explore trauma caused by men against women(obviously, the specifics of what they experience is extremely rare, and the details are hard to relate to. But the notion that some people, if not stopped, are simply going to keep hurting any female they can, really resonates). Ultimately, it could go even further. And it definitely would have been able to go deeper, if not for the trusted MCU formula demanding frequent action scenes. Thankfully, immensely talented director Cate Shortland does what she can (and that's a lot) to keep those scenes as intense and impactful as possible, by keeping the camera close, letting us feel every blow. There are some issues with the pacing and editing, that are most likely down to the movie not being completely done shooting before Corona restrictions were put in place, and a reluctance by the studio to postpone release until those rules were lifted. A decision which, honestly, is completely understandable. I won't spend long talking about Taskmaster, other than to say that, given what they clearly wanted to do there, they should simply have come up with a new character, or picked one that actually suited their needs, since now, they have frustrated(when that wasn't necessary or intentional at all) many who hoped for a more direct interpretation, and now merely distracts from a powerful and carefully thought-out depiction(as far as the ideas that this is exploring, they got it 100-percent spot-on).A little visible blood, and lasting wounds, push the PG-13 rating.

Upon conclusion however I personally felt it was good movie although there were things I diddn't like.First I felt the film almost lacked superhero feel. The movie played as more of Mission Impossible. With the plane jumping, explosions, car chases, etc. Also contributing to that was the super villian Taskmaster was severly under-utilized and lackluster. Secondly I diddn't really enjoy the entire family dynamic at all and felt at times it was cheesy and if anything detracted more from Black Widows story then it helped the movie along.With that said though I did think the visuals and sound effects in this movie were out of this world. I thought Scarlett Johansson continued her role of Black Widow very well. Also I found the movies pacing to be good especially for 2 hours I felt it breezed by and did enough to keep audience entertained without ever feeling draggy at all.Would I rewatch the movie ever again?

All this is true and does indeed detract a little bit from the movie.However. This movie has a great script that deals with the issues of family and what it means to be part of one. It draws parallels between Natasha's two families, both not real and at the same time all too real. It's a got strong emotional core at the heart of the movie, and that always goes a long way in creating a satisfying viewing experience. The performances are strong across the board with Pugh being particularly outstanding. The action sequences are MCU standard, that is, freaking incredible.In conclusion, this movie hit all the right buttons for me emotionally and viscerally. In the list of MCU movies.

The biggest crux of this film is its importance to the MCU. I can't say this movie really impacts the MCU very much or was even that necessary at this point given the events of Endgame. It also felt more like set up for Yelena than a solo Black Widow movie at times.The biggest highlight, besides Pugh (very Villanelle-like in the role) and Harbour, is the family dynamic. Taking cues from The Americans, the Russian spy family story was compelling stuff. The action was pretty brutal and what I wanted from this film. The opening sequence and credits were excellent and I was hoping that tone would keep up for the rest of the movie.For negatives, Marvel really needs to get out of their own way. The constant jokes during serious moments really undercuts the drama and actual character development. This is a continuing issue and this movie may be the worst example yet. Taskmaster might take the cake for most disappointing MCU villain, which is saying something, so I really hope they do more with that character.

Her character has grown to be a hardened assassin from childhood who you think would be very dry but Pugh still manages to have amazing personality and surprisingly great comedic timing.

Not only does everyone already love Natasha aka the Black Widow but the Marvel Universe brought in a new cast to love, specifically Yelena (Pugh) and Alexei (Harbour). These new characters brought out not only their own fun and strength but depth in Natasha's character as well. Definite scene stealers!The depth of the film. This movie touches on Natasha's childhood and a brief history of the Black Widows and how they are basically all human trafficked. You get a glimpse of the industry of girls trafficked and the abuse that goes on. It makes Natasha's story a lot more impactful, it wasn't only her that was sterilized and suffered a lot of pain.Great directing and action scenes! The director of this film did a great job, she captured a perfect combination of action, depth, sadness, intensity, lightness and humor. There are some scenes where the fighting and aftermath of the fight scenes is more realistic but yet some moments so huge it could never be realistic! Congrats to a job well done.Cons:\nVillains. The villain of this film is not captivating whatsoever. With comic book movies today the villain needs to be just as interesting half the time as the hero. In this case, it's not. You are more interested in the main characters by far. They needed a more personal touch to the villain and the impact on Natasha.Some violence was brutal. The fight scenes can be extremely violent and sometimes it's not really for any important reason. It would have been better if they saved extreme fight scenes for the important scenes. It would have been more meaningful.No cameos. If you were hoping for a big Marvel character cameo you will be disappointed. This movie takes place during Captain America Civil War and Avengers Infinity War when the Avengers are going through a rough patch, so we know they are off doing their own thing.

Without her, the movie probably would've been awful. I also really liked the post credits scene. It made me more interested in the Hawkeye Disney+ series.Unfortunately that's where the positives end. The action sequences were very disappointing. They're all filled with shaky cam and jump cuts which I found very disappointing. In fact, the directing and editing throughout the film is pretty bad. The villains are cartoon characters. Rachel Weiss and David Harbour are in this movie but there's nothing to really see from either of them. None of the humor really landed and the music was just terrible for the most part.The biggest problem with this movie is that it just doesn't feel like the people behind it really put their heart into it. It feels like it's just being made because people have asked for it and there's nothing it really has that's impactful on the universe other than Florence Pugh's character and the post credits scene. I also want to briefly talk about the third act. I've seen some people say that the movie is overall okay but the third act is something else. I gotta say this has got to be one of the weakest Marvel final battles.

Natasha made her debut in IRON MAN 2, and had been a mainstay of MCU films since. Though some fans have had problems with how her character was handled from one film to the other, Johansson's interpretation of the character created back in 1964 by Stan Lee, Don Rico, and Don Heck, developed a huge following, and of course, a demand that she get a solo film of her own same as Tony Stark, Steve Rogers, and Thor. When The Widow met her final fate in AVENGERS: ENDGAME, it was a gut punch of a twist, and seemed to forestall the possibility of a standalone movie, but Disney/Marvel found a way to give the fans what they wanted by making a film a set right after the events of CAPTAIN AMERICA: CIVIL WAR, where the Avengers were disbanded, and Natasha was a fugitive from the American government, and hiding in Europe for violating the Sokovia Accords.I made a point to see BLACK WIDOW cold, purposely avoiding any reviews, and most importantly, any spoilers. This aided my enjoyment of the movie tremendously. The film opens with a flashback to a happy family living in suburban Ohio in 1995, a father, a mother, and two young girls, but they are soon revealed to be deep cover Russian operatives; with their mission completed, and their cover blown, they flee America for Cuba in the first of THE BLACK WIDOW's many impressive action scenes. The older of the two sisters is Natasha, who, once in Cuba, is given over to The Red Room, a criminal organization that takes control of the minds of the girls it recruits, and trains both her, and her sister, to be assassins. Now, years later, the fugitive Natasha is back to reconnect with her former \"family,\" and take down The Red Room, and its leader, General Dreykov. Along the way, there are a number of well staged chase sequences, hand to hand combat, a breakout from an arctic Russian prison, a couple of plot twists and turns, and some genuine character development.BLACK WIDOW has scenes and plot threads which are clearly similar to THE AMERICANS, KILLING EVE, and a finale that echoed the end of WINTER SOLDIER. None of this I minded, as BLACK WIDOW takes those similarities and truly makes them its own. And like many other Marvel films, it has got the art of three act storytelling down pat. For all the great action scenes in the film, the story is truly anchored to the dinner table sequence at the end of the second act, when Natasha and her Russian \"family\" are finally all together, and they sit and talk about their mutual past, what was real, what was not, and what it meant, along with the enduring pain it caused. Its proof that even in an action heavy super hero film, it is necessary to build character, and get the audience invested in them. It also helps the cast great actors like Rachel Weisz as Natasha's \"mother,\" and David Harbour, as her \"father,\" the former Soviet super soldier known as The Red Tornado; Harbour's performance is a great balancing act of the dramatic and comedic, creating a past his prime super hero who refuses to quit. The breakout star of the film is Florence Pugh, as Natasha's little \"sister,\" a good assassin in her own right; Pugh was awesome in the horror film MIDSOMMAR, and she nearly eclipses Johansson here. When you cast Ray Winstone, who plays Derykov, as your main villain, than half the work is done. Some might be disappointed that Chris Evans, Robert Downey Jr. Samuel Jackson, or Mark Ruffalo didn't make cameos in their own iconic MCU roles, but the decision was made to keep the spotlight on Johansson, who more than earned her right to a solo star turn. William Hurt does appear as Thunderbolt Ross though, a way of connecting it all back to all those other film's continuity. I must give high praise to director Cate Shortland, and screenwriter, Eric Pearson; together they have given us a movie that is par beside the three Captain America films, which are the best of the MCU in my opinion.Of course there is a post credits scene, one that suggests we definitely have not seen the last of Florence Pugh's Belova. And please put Cate Shortland behind the camera of some other Marvel projects, she knows how to do it right. As for Scarlet Johansson's Natasha Romanoff, she will be sorely missed, but we've got a great film to remember her by."}, {"reviewer_name": "mateuskasprzak", "date": "12 July 2021", "text": "I know is a Marvel movie but Black Widow supouse to be a human but in this movie she looks like she could easily beat up Superman himself:) or Hela and walk away unharmed.

But it wasn't terrible, was actually pretty good to be honest.The one fatal mistake that I think most would agree on is that for some reason, this was conceived after Endgame. Because other than a little piece at the end, it has absolutely nothing to do with the events post-Endgame (2019), but mainly dealing in the aftermaths of CA: Civil War (2016), and Marvel had all the time in the world for that. It would've been meaningful and rather more shocking if this was released before Endgame - but right now, 2 years after? It just felt rather empty. Like an afterthought.

They are all well made, with a lot of action, good actors, great special effects and mostly good stories.But the big differences between Marvel from DC is humor. Marvel movies are funny. And they are not just full of simple gags. They have good and very original comedy. Just think of Guardians of the Galaxy. Those two were funny from the beginning to the end, and all their characters were memorable, likable, well connected with one another. DC's only two attempts at making their movies funny were Suicide Squad and Birds of Prey. Both failed miserably. They were fully of gags that were not at all funny. Their were like an amateur comedian's act, you know, where the guy is standing on stage in front of the big audience, sweating profusely, telling jokes and laughing at them while everyone else yawns.There was a whole slew of things wrong with Black Widow.The story was weak, and I am being kind here. Well, maybe the original comic was good, but the execution of that comic was anything but good. The action in some places was simply ridiculous. I can see Captain America or Vision jump off the tall building and land safely, but when a non-enhanced person like Black Widow falls for a ten storey height and hits every metal object on her way down and then rises with a itty bitty scratch on her hand, that makes you share your head. There were moments when I thought Optimus Prime would form himself from the falling rubble and say something heroic in his poorly disguised Irish accent. Even 007 movies try to make their action somewhat realistic.David Harbour was the only bright spot in this movie. He was really good and its mostly because of him I rated this movie with 3 stars. A side note. It's nice to see him in comedic roles. He managed to make another bad movie - Hellboy - watchable. Unfortunately, David Harbour couldn't save Black Widow. It was just not enough.Until I saw this movie, I thought the weakest one in the whole Marvel movie universe was Captain Marvel. But now I believe Black Widow has taken its place.It's really sad, you know, this strange lack of good writing. Makes me wonder. If they could make Loki, a wonderful TV series, why couldn't they do a better job with Black Widow.Oh, one more thing.

I believe if this movie came out in the beginning of phase three after civil war it could have done better but coming out now when we have seen the new series like Wandavision, Falcon and the Winter Soldier and Loki it couldn't match the same standard.

These are some of the words whose meanings you will find generously and proficiently, almost lovingly, applied in each scene of this unpredictably depthful movie.Cate Shortland's directorial genius has truly contributed something 'new' to the MCU.Such inspiring, symbolic, and visceral screenplay from Eric Pearson, Jac Schaeffer, and Ned Benson. The timing of every scene was so spot-on that even a 'fake spy family' ended up looking like the real deal. I truly felt 'betrayed' and 'angry' watching the later scenes unfold. My compliments to the writers.The accent coaches did a great job as well.Any worthy cinema fan will agree that Scarlett Johansson - who plays the titular Black Widow, aka Natasha Romanoff - has excellent acting chops, a fact uniquely highlighted in this 'superhero' movie.On that note, I feel inclined to state that without Florence Pugh - who plays Natasha's sister, Yelena Belova - this film would have found itself gravely imbalanced. She was brilliant and funny and stylish, all in one.David Harbour's Alexei \"Red Guardian\" (hate the character, love the performance) and Rachel Weisz's Melina (always been a fan of Weisz) added their own special ingredients to this heart-felt film.It was packed with some of the most 'serious film-making' tropes I have seen in connection to Marvel movies.The younger versions of Natasha and Yelena - Ever Anderson and Violet McGraw, respectively - gave creditable performances.Ray Winstone's take on Dreykov was downright diabolical. He was amazing. I thoroughly enjoyed watching him get his comeuppance at the end.Good VFX.Intense stunts - especially vehicle-related.Remarkable action and fight scenes/choreo. The 'Widows vs Natasha' fight sequence was lit - it was absolutely predatorial and unnerving.The concepts involving the 'Red Room' (from its introduction and design to its fiery end) and the 'Widows' were significant to the plot.Stellar costume design by Lisa Lovaas and Jany Temime. Natasha's white suit is perfection. The black one will always be her signature look, though.The comedic (perhaps at times dark comedy) scenes and lines were so perfectly timed - I loved every one of them.The mind-control-reversal-spray, aka 'Red Dust', was good, but I wasn't entirely convinced as to its real-world efficacy. It worked too swiftly to undo several years of ingrained programming. As I write this point, I am imagining smacking myself on the forehead. This is a Marvel movie, not a full-fledged real-life drama.That said, nearly every mind-control concept explored in this film held substance. There is much truth and historical precedent for some of the will-bending ideas that Melina shared with the others at the shockingly casual 'dinner table' scene. An all-female spy unit is not unheard of in the History books either. You won't found these particular books in your average classroom, that's for sure.The idea behind an international and coordinated ring of spies is most probably the technique that 'shadow governments' use to run the show. When it comes to this topic, your guess is as good as mine.The pro-spy technologies and innovations, especially those 'digital' facemasks, were exemplary.The relation between covert spy organizations and their reliance on \"chemically subjugated agents\" is no ordinary idea, especially judging by the literature that's already out there on the subject.Lorne Balfe's musical score only strengthened the candour and gut-wrenching emotions that Shortland wove into several frames of this deservedly award-worthy film.Gabriel Beristain's cinematography was but the cream on this already lush and delightful pie.Variety magazine wrote a piece about Johansson practically insisting that Cate Shortland direct this film. I breathe a sigh of relief that it worked, else \"Black Widow\" 2021 wouldn't have turned out to be the stuff of filmmaking dreams.I did NOT see that plot-twist coming, though. It should have been obvious, the one involving Melina and Natasha swapping 'appearances'. Directing... Shortland... Genius...\nOn the other hand, I long suspected that Taskmaster, aka Antonia Dreykov (played by Olga Kurylenko), was Natasha's original mother. I guess reading all those Agatha Christies paid off, to some extent anyway.That post-credit scene! Nuf said. Valentina Allegra de Fontaine (played by Julia Louis-Dreyfus) is agent myst\u00e8re indeed (shoutout to her role in \"Falcon And The Winter Soldier\" series).And oh Clint Barton (aka Hawkeye, played by Jeremy Renner), what did you do!?This movie is so NOT like the MCU's usual fare, and I believe that's precisely what made it stand out. It wasn't flashy, overly commercial, or prone to inspiring raucous applause from viewers. Nevertheless, it inspired goosebumps of an entirely different sort, one that you must see this film to experience.So many scenes in this movie contained palpable tension and relatable pain. The story made me feel and think about the inherent meanings integrated into several different shots.From a strictly cinematic and technical perspective, Marvel Studios \"Black Widow\" should be the company's gold standard - at least, for its roster of 'supers' without any real powers. As the movie neared its finish, all I can say is: goosebumps, goosebumps, goosebumps everywhere.I have enjoyed everything MCU over the years, but this movie takes the grand cake. \"Black Widow\" has every chance of earning Marvel Studios an Oscar nod, perhaps even a win in at least one category; if not more.This movie injected such meaning into the enduring spirit of the Human Will. It infused its core characters with the undying power and legacy of the Female Heart to survive any atrocity committed against it - and to extract justice at the opportune time.This movie also declares, in no uncertain terms, that family doesn't necessarily have to be related. It proves that there's more - oh, so much more - to family than just blood."}, {"reviewer_name": "gulshanguleria", "date": "9 July 2021", "text": "Ok so I wasn't expecting much but it was well made movie, actually I lost the habit of watching a film of marvel because we are watching series from a long time, And yes it brought back Marvel to movies.

They're thrill-numbingly proficient at escaping close call after close, those Marvel set-piece cliffhangers that in the hands of their Disney overlords have evolved into a familiar trudge through a step-by-step routine of ye oldie actiony tropes - the falling thing that propels the hero to safety through a window; the multiple bad guys who are still required to line up and attack one by one instead of working as a team; the failing upwards of every plan; the what would Ethan Hunt do practically that we can do less memorably with CGI.Really, it's fine.The world is in danger, again, as per, by its biggest threat yet: Ray Winstone's Russian accent. Ray plays the role of who TF cares old-man-in-a-suit villain, huffing and puffing his way through exposition while walking around a desk in order to fiddle nefariously with his McGuffin.No, wait, it's fine.Olga Kurylenko plays Taskmaster, Black Widow's necessary end-of-level nemesis.

JUST ENJOY THE MOVIE FOR WHAT IT IS, A MOVIE!I think it's great."}, {"reviewer_name": "thesar-2", "date": "10 July 2021", "text": "When I wanted them to make a stand-alone Black Widow movie all the way back to her premiering in the lackluster Iron Man 2, I kinda wanted it when she was alive. But I guess going back in time is what the MCU does best now.(Just a clarification, that's not a spoiler for this movie. It's just part of the MCU that she passes in Avengers: Endgame and that's acknowledged here.)To put my feeling for the MCU in perspective, none of the 24 Avenger movies fall into my top 20 action movies of all time. Not that they were bad, plenty of them were good to great. It's just, most of them are comedies first and action/comic book movies second...or third. Such in the case of both Iron Man 3 and Thor: Ragnarok. Both were 80% comedies with a smidge of action.Mercifully, Black Widow is less of a comedy, although the one running gag (Posing) was funny and creative and a few other jokes landed. Not terribly funny, but luckily, this isn't meant to be funny. Nope, in this case: it's 80% drama and 20% action.Don't get me wrong; 2 of the 3-4 action scenes were good, the now-overused, yet still fun climax being the best, but the action was so few and far in-between and sadly, I just didn't connect with the \"drama\" and \"sad-scenes\" very well. I never felt bad for these people, even when kids were involved. Maybe it's because the movie was SO COLD, little heart could be felt.After a solid cold opening showing our infamous Natasha Romanoff, aka The Title Character, as a kid about to become said Title Character, we fast-forward to her well-established as the Black Widow. Well, one of them, anyways. There we see her go on a very basic and simple mission with her estranged sister and family.Oh, and they probably mentioned the word \"Avengers\" more times in this movie and her connection to them than all 4 actual Avenger movies combined.My biggest problem with this movie is that I wanted to see either A: An Origin Story of her trials and tribulations of becoming my 2nd favorite Avenger behind Captain Steve Rogers or B: she's already Black Widow and she smartly kicks as much ass as she's done with every other appearance of hers in the MCU. Well, I did get about 7 minutes of that origin story and about 10 minutes of her actually being the kick-ass super-spy we all love. Those 10 minutes are the last 10 minutes of the movie. The rest of the movie, and here's the problem, SHE IS BLACK WIDOW throughout the movie, sans those original 7 minutes in the cold-open. So...why do they make her so oh-hum throughout? She's not learning to become Black Widow; she's been that way since the opening credits. We just finally get her bad-assery in the closing and by then I was incredibly bored with so many overly dramatic and predictable, drawn-out scenes.But, that was my biggest issue. In truth, it wasn't that bad of the movie, even though a ton of it was generic action scenes or family drama never reaching tension. I did enjoy Scarlett, as always, but here she just felt like Sean Connery coming back for Never Say Never Again. Like this was just a paycheck for her.While it's a mild recommendation, it's not at all necessary to see this movie in connection with the others except for the weak-post credit scene (all the way at the end of the 20 minutes of credits.) It felt so much like a mid-season storyline/couple of episodes of a TV season - never as great as the first 2 episodes and definitely less fun/excitement as the season finale's last few episodes. Think of it as episode 4-6 of a 9-part TV season.***Final Thoughts: Here's my updated ranking of all the MCU movies with stars, Best to WORST:1 Marvel's The Avengers (4\u00bd/5 Stars.)\n2 Captain America: The First Avenger (4\u00bd/5 Stars.)\n3 Guardians of the Galaxy (4\u00bd/5 Stars.)\n4 Avengers: Infinity War (4\u00bd/5 Stars.)\n5 Iron Man (4/5 Stars.)\n6 Captain America: The Winter Soldier (4/5 Stars.)\n7 Spider-Man: Far From Home (4/5 Stars.)\n8 Captain America: Civil War (3\u00bd/5 Stars.)\n9 Thor: Ragnarok (3\u00bd/5 Stars.)\n10 Avengers: Endgame (3\u00bd/5 Stars.)\n11 Doctor Strange (3/5 Stars.)\n12 Ant-Man (3/5 Stars.)\n13 Ant-Man and the Wasp (3/5 Stars.)\n14 Black Panther (3/5 Stars.)\n15 The Incredible Hulk (3/5 Stars.)\n16 Iron Man 3 (3/5 Stars.)\n17 Black Widow (2\u00bd/5 Stars.)\n18 Thor: The Dark World (2\u00bd/5 Stars.)\n19 Avengers: Age of Ultron (2\u00bd/5 Stars.)\n20 Spider-Man: Homecoming (2\u00bd/5 Stars.)\n21 Iron Man 2 (2/5 Stars.)\n22 Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 (2/5 Stars.)\n23 Captain Marvel (2/5 Stars.)\n24 Thor (2/5 Stars.)"}, {"reviewer_name": "killercola", "date": "22 July 2021", "text": "Enough with these movies.

This movie is full of action scenes, especially the hunt with the BMW X3 through the streets of Budapest is fun to watch. This makes this movie really for the big screen. Scarlett Johansson and Florence Pugh play well off each other. David Harbour is very loose and funny as the Red Guardian. And Ray Winstone is viscerally effective as the megalomaniacal villain Dreykov.Light, humorous and uplifting, this film touches on themes of sibling rivalry, grievances with estranged parents and female defiance in the face of gender-based exploitation. An all around substantive and likeable film. Strongly recommended to devout MCU fans and even neophytes to the franchise."}, {"reviewer_name": "ayoreinf", "date": "14 July 2021", "text": "Black Widow is the one single worthy creation of the MCU. That is the single creation that was actually created in the MCU. Yes, like all the other Avengers she was also originally created in the comics books, but unlike all the others Black Widow of the comics books is a collection of fragments that sometime contradict previous ones, not a real living breathing creature like Captain America, The Hulk, Iron Man. Even The Vision and the Scarlet Witch got more character built for them in the comics books (which the MCU failed to use, but TV seems to be taking it over now). But the Black Widow we come to know and love is the creation of the movies the directors, the writers and more than anyone else - the creation of Scarlett Johansson who made Natasha Romanoff her own.Now there are two possible reasons for her demise at the Avengers Endgame - either she didn't want to keep on doing this role or the directors producers decided they didn't want her anymore. I've been thinking a lot about this issue. I've listened very carefully to Scarlett own words regarding her role as the Black Widow. I can't believe she didn't want to keep on doing it. She probably won't say a thing, she's a professional and she knows the rules of the game, but she knows she still had more to give as the fiery spy she created. The problem is why would the creative team of the Marvel MCU want to finish her off? Well, as I said I thought a lot about this question and I personally believe she became too big for her own good. They never thought of her as anything more than a secondary role and were surprised themselves by her growing popularity, popularity that forced them to give her a full size movie dedicated to her exploits. But they couldn't let it grow any further, so they killed her and I personally hate it more than any other stupid thing they did in Endgame in order to surprise us.Now, lets examine this movie for itself. It doesn't always make sense. Like I wouldn't advise anyone to try severing a nerve to the brain for a minor example. But on the other hand it has wonderful roles and superlative acting by the entire cast. Even if some of them don't really have the complete character making sense like Natasha Romanoff does or like the great complete roles written down for Florence Pugh and for David Harbour. Ray Winstone gets a very good villain role to play, and he plays it well. They all do even, the incomplete ones like Rachel Weisz. So we get an action film with a very big heart and a very big moral issue carried with it. It may not be to everybody's liking but I personally loved it, and I don't think Scarlett Johansson would have taken it any other way. I'm not going to discuss anything else regarding this movie - it's all done very professionally and it's all beside the point."}, {"reviewer_name": "subteacher-imdb", "date": "13 July 2021", "text": "I enjoyed this movie. The action scenes were some of the best since Winter Soldier. Great performances by Pugh and Johansson. The film score is also one of the best out of all MCU films. Classical music enthusiasts will recognize Shostakovich inspiration in it as they listen.My biggest hang ups are that the writing of the movies continue to 1) shoehorn comedy in when it isn't necessary, and 2) weaken villains and make them less commanding. Red Raider was annoying as the attempted comic relief to no fault of the actor. I found his character irredeemable based on just how annoying and tone deaf he was written. Also, Taskmaster (while very intimidating at first) ended up being a shell of its comic counterpart.

The chemistry with between Pugh and Johansson is decent enough, and the initial fight between widow and task master was cool.The family drama is forced. The dinner table scene moves from flat comedy to drama in order to create artificial conflict with the main cast.However Task Master eventually takes a back seat to the forced family drama and the reveal at the end is predictable. The action itself is one of the most disappointing aspects of the film. None of it was exciting and it's been done better in other marvel movies. Every fight is quick cuts to hide the stunt-double. All of these A list actors take big money but don't put in the effort to learn choreography so we can understand what the heck is going on in a fight. The constant reminder I'm watching a stunt double took me out of every fight in the movie. When the Marvel 3rd act CGI battle happens Natasha turns full CGI and it's boring. All the action is dull and lifeless. Another problem with the action is how slick and boring the style of the movie is. There is no grit in Black Widow. Marvel and Disney are too afraid to take any chances with a tone or style of the movie. Instead of making this solo film something suspense filled and grounded we have a marvel movie we have already seen a million times before. A missed opportunity to make a grounded superhero feel real. Sort of like what Nolan did with his Batman trilogy.Eventually everything ends in Black Widow after the overlong final battle and everyone is super happy. Natasha changes her hair color and everyone can be happy leaving the theatre. Yawn! Black Widow is pure formula. Never taking any chances to deviate from the path set by ten years of previous marvel films. Everything is so convenient and tidy that I want to roll my eyes. Black Widow never made me gasp in excitement, tremble with suspense or tear up because I become so invested in the characters. Comfort food is what Black Widow is and if that is your thing you're most likely very easy to please and right dumb reviews like the Top review for this movie, or your as sad as anyone who looks at reviews on IMDB and dislikes them because they have differing opinions than you. If you fit into either of those categories I'm sure Black Widow is the movie for you. High production values does not equal substance. You love Black Widow but Hate F9?

Right... They could have at least surgically severed it, and had her manipulate him into thinking it wasn't. Nope, she slams her face on the desk, because that better shows how good of a spy she is.Then the Red Room is just floating in the sky with some artificial clouds obscuring it - and nobody ever noticed it?There's all that shrapnel falling directly over-head, but the parachutes are left unscathed?Just incredibly lazy.

It gives you a back story,some action and if u watch the post credits a hint at what's to come. Watching the film already knowing how it ends for black widow does take something away from the film but isn't detrimental enough to stop it being fully enjoyable. The fight sequences are very good and adequate airtime given to other characters,the only real exception being taskmaster who I felt could have been utilised better.

It had a great plot, amazing characters, and FANTASTIC music!The problems i found with the movie was unfortunately 3 things. Villain, timing, and Yelena.I loved Yelena's character, don't get me wrong. But as a last tribute to Natasha, it was unfortunate that only a minor part of the plot felt like it was about her. Since this is (most likely) the last time we'll see Nat, it was quite irritating that this was the movie they chose to set up Yelena's future in the MCU.Now onto the villain: Taskmaster. Whilst taskmaster is an EXCELLENT choice for this movie, and personally one of my favorite villiana of all time, it felt not only odd, but also dumb that they genderswapped the character. I would MUCH rather have it that it turns out Dreykovs daughter ran the red room and wanted revenge on Nat, rather than her being a mindless puppet.Lastly is a small but unfortunate problem: The Timing! If this would have come out before infinity war, it would have felt so much more refreshing. Especially since it sets up the future and takes place after Civil War.But nonetheless it was an amzing action movie that i would recommend to anyone who's a fan of greatly coordinated fights, DOPE music and Black Widow herself!"}, {"reviewer_name": "alexbrogan00", "date": "12 July 2021", "text": "This film could have been better, ironically also meeting my expectations.

I also loved the bond between Yelena and Natasha (Scarlett) as they are sarcastic yet charismatic together. Alongside with the chemistry between Rachel Weisz and David Harbour (who is hilarious in the film). But my big issue with Black Widow is that it mostly feels like what you expect from a Marvel movie. With some of the over-the-top action scenes with fights, explosions, and epic orchestral's. Including teaming up with people at a secret base and having them help the protagonist in the climax. There also is humor as you would expect from a Marvel movie, I laughed at some of the jokes and implied humor but it felt a little too constant.

It was an incredible showcase for 4DX, with all of its car crashes, hand-to-hand combat and explosions. The chairs almost throw you out onto the floor at some points. One particular segment ended with an audible \"wow\" from the audience, and laughs after the violently shaking chairs finally stopped. I saw my first 4DX \"snow,\" thanks to one scene set in a wintery locale. At one point, the 4DX put out a giant plume of smoke that was just too much. It obscured half the screen for a couple of minutes. The smoke's the only part of 4DX I would do away with. The 3D also looked very pleasing to the eye, with a lot of shots with noticeable depth. I think Godzilla: King of the Monsters was the only 4DX I've seen that was more intense than this one.It looks like Marvel Studios might've spent the year-long delay of this movie polishing up the effects and tightening up the editing, because this is one of the MCU's most technically flawless movies. Kevin Feige clearly has a well-oiled machine in place to produce these films. The movie's credited director has only directed three no-budget films before, so it's inconceivable to me that she could pull off a production this massive with so little experience without a lot of help.I thought that overall this was one of the strongest MCU movies. It was a welcome change of pace to see a down-to-earth spy thriller after the heavy sci-fi and superhero storyline in Endgame. This, at different times, felt like the 1980s G. I. Joe cartoon, the James Bond franchise and the Mission: Impossible movies. My two favorite MCU movies are Winter Soldier and Endgame. I enjoyed this one just about as much as Winter Soldier. It was definitely much more entertaining than their other recent film Captain Marvel, a dull, dry outing that is one of my least favorite MCU movies.Black Widow probably has plot holes, but it's so fast-paced and action-packed that you don't have a lot of spare time to think about the plot. This movie functions on the level of pure action, making it almost a pointless exercise to analyze the story. Therefore, I also wasn't too concerned about what any of the \"reveals\" were going to be. There isn't a lot of time to think during this movie. There's only one three-minute scene in the middle when the momentum grinds to a halt, and half the theater seemed to be checking their phones or muttering to each other. Then things pick right back up. There's a lot of backstory in the film covered in flashbacks and dialogue exchanges. I think I understood MOST of it, which is a laudable achievement for the film considering how incomprehensible a lot of spy thrillers can get.As it goes on, the movie loses some of its down-to-earth grit and gets more over-the-top and less plausible. By the end, it starts to feel more like a comic book and less like an adult spy thriller, because of the incredible feats of derring-do that the characters are able to pull off. But I can't really complain about that, because I knew going in this is based on a comic book, and not on the grittiest or most hard-boiled source material. Still, maybe there are some difficult situations that the characters get out of just a little too smoothly and easily at times.Florence Pugh was the most interesting actor to watch in the film. As the \"other\" Black Widow in the movie, she was the second most important character to pull off, and she achieved that to the maximum extent possible. She's the one character in the movie I would eagerly anticipate seeing more of, if possible. As for ScarJo, this is probably her best performance as Black Widow, but I still feel she was miscast in the role from the beginning. Emily Blunt would've nailed this part in a way ScarJo just isn't capable of. I feel satisfied now that I've seen enough of ScarJo in the MCU, and she can be retired. I didn't recognize Ray Winstone in this film. I'm not that familiar with him, but he sure gave a different, and better, performance here than he did in Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull. The Red Guardian character, as indicated in the trailers, is largely here to provide comic relief. He was something of a caricature and not the best part of the movie by a long shot. I enjoyed him more when he was given some moments of dignity.I feel like this movie leaves wide open the possibility that we may get a similar Captain America movie, set between Civil War and Infinity War. If I recall, what Steve Rogers was doing during that time was left just as vague as what Natasha was doing. For any new fans to the MCU, I think this movie should be watched in chronological order after Civil War, EXCEPT for the post-credits epilogue. The home video release ought to move that to a bonus feature with spoiler warnings.On an unrelated note, as a G. I. Joe franchise fan, I'm greatly disappointed that the G. I. Joe movies don't feel a lot more like Winter Soldier and Black Widow. 1980s G. I. Joe was based right off of the Marvel Avengers comics in many ways, but the people making the G. I. Joe movies don't have 1% of the understanding that Marvel Studios does of how these kinds of stylized action-adventure stories are supposed to be done."}, {"reviewer_name": "jwhosie", "date": "7 July 2021", "text": "Strong storyline, good action and gives more depth to the Black Widow character that has been such a key piece of the MCU."}, {"reviewer_name": "razvanciobo", "date": "11 July 2021", "text": "Black Widow didn't disappoint.

The rest of the review is spoiler-freeI'm a huge MCU fan and I've been looking forward to this for a while. Unfortunately, it wasn't everything I hoped it would be.The main cast is excellent. Scarlett, Florence, David, and Rachel play off each other wonderfully and it's very fun to watch.Like I said in the title, the biggest flaw here is the action. After a 25 minute opening there isn't as much time to do stuff so they need to get straight to the character development and the plot. However, there are so many action sequences that the movie never gets a chance to touch on much else. Once the prolouge ends, there are literally 3 fights in the span of 30 minutes. Not just that, but the fights take up most of that time. It goes like this: Fight scene - 2 minutes of talking - Fight scene - 5 minutes explaining the villian and the plot - Fight scene. The action takes time away from characters and other things a movie needs to have for it to be good. The Natasha vs Yelena fight (fight is in the trailer so this isn't a spoiler) didn't even need to happen. They could've skipped that fight and nothing would've changed.The special effects weren't always the best, but considering this was supposed to come out almost 2 years ago I'll give that a pass.I did enjoy the story and the action, although there is a lot, it was fun which is important considering it's a superhero movie. The soundtrack was also really enjoyable and the opening credits were creepy as hell. The jokes land most of the time as well.Taskmaster was terrible. First, literally all the stuff she does is in the trailer so whenever she is on screen its never exciting because you know everything that's about to happen. Also, all the scenes where Taskmaster copies other heroes (Hawkeye, Black Panther, ect.) are shown in the trailers as well so once again theres nothing exciting when she does it because you already know it's going to happen. Lastly, what were they thinking getting rid of Tony Masters and replacing him with a girl? To be clear, I'm not sexist and I have no problem with genderbending if it's done well, but they absolutely butcher the version of Taskmaster in the comics. Even the Mandarin twist in Iron Man 3 was better than this. And then they are going to give her a redemption arc? They've been doing that with a lot of villians lately (Ghost, Karli, Loki, etc) and it's starting to get old.Unfortunately this is one of the weaker entries in the MCU. Definitely not the worst but there are a lot of better films in the franchise.

One big thing I noticed as well that kind of shocked me was some of the shoddy VFX work, there are some parts with explosions that look like they could have been ripped from an early 2000s X-Men film.If you're a MCU fan this film will satisfy you and I will admit that sitting in the cinema for the first time since lockdown started in the UK and watching the first marvel film to be released in around 2 years I did have a great time, excited for what's going on in the rest of phase 4 but it it's off to a slow start."}, {"reviewer_name": "jp_91", "date": "14 July 2021", "text": "I'm not a fan of superhero movies, \"Black Widow\" works well without be a masterpiece, decent performances from the cast and a superb performance from Florence Pugh.

Due to the fact that we've had to wait for it fir over a year because of Covid it made expecations even higher. Not all of the films in the MCU are masterpieces but most of them are entertaining and somewhat memorable. Black Widow for me has been one of the best characters in the Marvel Universe and I don't understand why she never got her own stand alone film until after we know her fate in Avengers: Endgame. But we finally get this film and unfortunately it is one of the weakest MCU films since it started in 2008 with Iron Man.Scarlett Johanssen is credited as an executive producer on the film so I think she had some say in the direction the film but she should have gotten a better script. The film is set in after the events of Captain America: Civil War. Natasha Romanoff is on tge run because The Avengers are all being hunted. We get some backstort with Natasha as a kid with her sister Yekelana and her supposed parents Melina and Alexei. The movie is not really an origin story but it deals with some of the things that formed Natasha into the woman she is. The film feels very jokey and lazy at the same time. There is a good chemistry between Scarlet Johanssen and Florence Pugh who plays Yelena. Pugh gives the best performance in the film. She is very funny and fleshes out her character well. Rachel Weisz\nIs and David Harbour are good in their roles but are really just comic relief. The action is not particularly exciting. Nothing we've never seen before. The main villain Dreykov is also very weak. As fantastical as these types of films are they work when they involve us is what's happening. We get invested in the story. It did not feel invested. The action is over the top as expected but is really just average. There is no sense of danger. The CGI dominates so much that it just isn't exciting.

The film is directed by Cate Shortland, the director of Lore and Berlin Syndrome.In the film, Natasha Romanoff (Scarlett Johansson) is on the run from the government after violating the Sokovia Accord. She goes into hiding in areas where she has lived in her past and is trained to be a super spy Black Widow. By visiting these places, she is confronted by her past and encounters old acquaintances. She crosses paths with Yelena Belova (Florence Pugh), who also completed the Black Widow training. Together, they try to stop the organization behind the Black Widow training sessions, but to do so must face spies of their level and the mysterious Taskmaster.This film was Cate Shortland's first directing work of a major action film. She had even rejected the film as a director at first, but Scarlett Johansson managed to persuade her to direct the film anyway. The fact that this is her first directing work of an action film is unfortunately reflected in the quality of the film. Despite the fact that most of the action scenes are entertaining, they also come across a bit too moving and a bit juxtaposed. The last action scenes also clearly show that the actors are standing in front of a green screen and that the explosions, like many other explosions in the film, have been placed in the film with CGI.The story of the film also comes across as a standard spy movie, but here at a slow pace. In the story, unfortunately, they also choose to overshadow the drama moments with comedy. This also makes the film lose its depth. The film also has some nice links for the fans with other Marvel films, but at one point also chooses to copy other Marvel films, so that moments can come across as familiar to Marvel fans.The acting is fortunately well done by the film cast. This is Scarlett Johansson's ninth time playing the Black Widow character in the Marvel film series. Despite her character playing the lead role in this movie, she plays the role better in most other Marvel movies. Florence Pugh is best portrayed in the film. Together with Scarlett Johansson, they create a nice mutual chemistry, which comes across as the love-hate relationship between two sisters. Viewers who have siblings of their own can relate to some of the moments the two bring out together in the film. David Harbor provides most of the comedic moments in the film, but does not get much else to do in the film. Rachel Weisz also has a small role in the film, which only helps the story move forward."}, {"reviewer_name": "elliemac-33843", "date": "7 July 2021", "text": "Just watched this in the cinema today and wow I cried and smiled so much, the ending was not expected and I'm exited to see what marvel brings next!!"}, {"reviewer_name": "aaaaaadil-17346", "date": "12 July 2021", "text": "The movie was really really good but the taskmaster storyline was really boring.

If you like anything else Marvel does there's no reason you won't like this.

There's not much else I really can say about it... I'm not a professional film critic and don't really want to deep-dive into the pros and cons, I just want to say that I think this is great and really stands up to the likes of the latest Thor and Guardians films.

The worst about this movie was the story of it. The characters development was also a mess! I kind of got some feminism vibe ( hating man) from this movie because this movie only had three men in it. One of them was nothing only a supporter to natasha. Second one was the re guardian! If you ever read the comics you would probably know that he is so powerful but they made him a total clown in this movie. And the third was the villain of this movie they also made him so powerless in this movie. They also changed the origin of Taskmaster he was a man born with the power! But instead day made him a woman and changed the whole story, i mean that's fine by me if they only make him a woman but still is stick to the origin of the character from original story. This movie had a great potential to be one of the best Marvel's movie but instead they ruined it. What are the best thing about this movie was the cast of this movie.

Her chemistry with Johansson is electric and makes you buy into the sisters' journey and shared pain easily.David Harbour is incredible as the 'Red Guardian'', the weathered the former Russian counterpart to Captain America. Rachel Weisz and him are spot on as the parental figures, essaying the pain and suffering they have undergone with authenticity and realism. Ray Winstone is his icy, brutish best as the main antagonist.The key standout element of the film was the excellently choreographed hand-to-hand combat sequences, really raising the level of Marvel movies to Bourne-esque realms.Watch out for not one but two surprise guest appearances that not only tie into the upcoming MCU films but also continue the intricate world-building happening through the Disney+ series' Loki, TFATWS and Wanda Vision.Black Widow is a Natasha Romanoff show through and through, a fitting tribute to a founding Avenger and a role that has been portrayed with such perfection by Scarlett Johansson for over a decade now.Highly recommended!

It's boring, story is weak and, we see a lot of Scarlett Johansson, who has, unfortunately, passed her prime, so, it's even kind of depressing.Then Alexei comes along. He's a breath of fresh air, but, in a feminist movie such as this, they don't let him shine; he's mostly there to be silly.Rachel Weisz looks amazing for her age, almost to the point of looking better than Scarlett Johansson. But, she's not nearly as interesting or funny as it was intended.Similar goes for Yelena, who was obviously meant to be cute and funny, but she's neither.Second half's not _that_ bad, but it's mediocre at best. It makes little sense, even though this is supposed to be \"not really a superhero movie\", so it should make decent amount of sense. The action sequences are pretty bad and the CGI is at times terrible. The Harvey Weinstein references are way too obvious, done badly and are pretty much worn out at this point.From a certain point of view, this is very unfortunate, because the movie set out to prove that Black Widow is good for a stand-alone movie.

I don't know how anyone can say this film has no heart and is all action and explosions.One thing I've truly enjoyed as more women are getting a shot at directing is the emotional content and character development they typically bring to what could be over the top action films. There aren't a ton of those moments in a film like this, so the key is to make them count. The interplay between Yelena and Natasha is at times poignant and at others cutting. David Harbour also does a good job as the self absorbed father figure.I don't think we have to view this film as having wasted or ruined Taskmaster either. Let's think back to Origins: Wolverine and consider how we felt about Deadpool. Seems that worked out fine in the end, yes? I fully expect to see a more traditional rendition of Taskmaster in other MCU properties.The plot was predictable, but it was actually refreshing not to have the writers and director think they can pull one over on the audience for a change. It doesn't always have to be about the plot twist.The ending left the MCU open to taking Black Widow in a new direction, or at least adding another high caliber actor to the universe. Personally I'm a fan of Florence Pugh and look forward to what she can bring to the MCU.In the end this film met my expectations, which were high considering the cast and director. Its pretty rare when these films exceed my expectations, because I've actually read the source material.

Movie-goers who have eagerly awaited a Star Wars prequel featuring Ma and Pa Vader and baby Darth will probably enjoy Black Widow, while fans of the franchise will likely be disappointed. The characters talk about the Avengers, Tony Stark, and Captain America, but not even a brief cameo or an Avengers logo is shown.With many in Hollywood apparently still clinging to discredited allegations of Russian collusion, the villains are Russians . . . More or less. The main Russians are played by British performers Ray Winstone, Rachel Weisz, and Florence Pugh, and Americans David Harbour and Scarlett Johansson. To avoid any allegations of cultural appropriation, none of the performers, with the notable exception of Harbor, seems to act very Russian, even while drinking vodka and speaking Russian.Part of the reason the actors don't seem authentically Russian may be attributed to the self-conscious diversity among the throngs of evil minions. Russia is generally considered somewhat less racially tolerant and inclusive than the Antebellum South, but the throngs of elite female assassins in their leather bondage outfits are ethnically diverse, as they prepare to turn tables on men who treat women as subservient. Unlike most movies, they wear no hoods or masks, to fully display that they are female and diverse. But the notion of Russians tolerating racial diversity among an elite corps of commando assassins seems improbable, leaving the impression of pandering to progressives - which also seems incongruous in a film featuring extrajudicial executions, assassinations, unauthorized wiretaps, enhanced interrogations, et cetera.The movie seems to be about 40% family drama, 30% feminist female empowerment, 20% action, and 10% gratuitous CGI effects, with a generous measure of misandry throughout.The plot is an absurd contrivance based on radical feminist talking points exaggerated to comic proportions. The villain's actions make little sense, unless one ignores logic and assumes he is an insane misogynistic megalomaniac. It also makes little dramatic sense, as the action is reduced to manipulating images on a huge computer display. In a fashion worthy of Dr Evil, the villain made sure his years of preparation could be undone with a few keystrokes and built his secret fortress so the slightest damage would trigger a sequence of cataclysmic explosions.As is common among many recent Hollywood productions, there is no typical B-story romance, offering instead a tale of sisterly love between two girls who aren't really sisters and aren't particularly lovable.There are several well-choreographed action scenes, including several fights among female martial artists. Harbour's performance is noteworthy, until he is sucked into the maudlin family drama. The movie is a disappointment on several levels. The family drama is so bogged down in the mundane that the fantastic aspects of the superhero story seem less credible, particularly due to numerous gaps in the plot. Beyond that, the film seems a harbinger of future disappointing efforts by a film industry that increasingly seems more concerned with virtue signaling, posturing and proselytizing about political correctitude than entertaining audiences."}, {"reviewer_name": "alice-53932", "date": "14 July 2021", "text": "Just Wow.

Fresh from my MCU marathon ending with Endgame, I was skeptical of shows like WandaVision or Falcon & Winter Soldier, which had premises that didn't sound interesting to me but I ended up really liking. Black Widow was a movie I also had little interest in, but from my recent experiences I thought I'd give it the benefit of the doubt and hope it would get some of that MCU magic.Alas, there is very little about that movie I liked. First and foremost, the fake Russian accents coming and going for no reason really irked me. It really didn't help what I thought were subpar acting performances from actors I know can deliver a ton more than they do here (Johansson, Harbour, Weisz, etc.). The directing was all over the place, action scenes were a hot mess, and some of the special effects were a disgrace for something with the MCU stamp on it. The story and writing have so many plot holes and things that don't make sense I'm not going to even try and count them.Very disappointing overall, and by far the weakest MCU movie to date.

I'm not gonna say it's wrong. Personally though, I have no clue why Marvel feels the need to start tackling political topics. I get it, they want to be informative, and that's great, I respect that; but they're a company which makes superhero films. I can't speak for other people, but I don't have fictional characters as my idols now, but as a child I would. But even then, how am I going to understand the fact that the Falcon gets racial discrimination? I just don't see the point. Why would I go to watch a film about a superhero to learn to respect women, and why would I watch something because its main attraction for audiences is the fact that it's left wing and politically sound with decent human standards? It's not a bad thing, but I don't want to be lectured when I already understand that women should have equal rights no questions asked. In short, while I liked the action and thought it was more structured than the Falcon and the Winter borefest, it annoys me that Marvel can't just let women and men and all races and sexualities be equal in a regular way (normalising it) rather than having to go out their way to say \"Hey look, it's a female! Now we should all know being a female is cool, but females go through a struggle every day!\" It isn't appealing to me certainly, and judging by the reviews, it appeals to some people, but not everyone, which seems to be different from most Marvel Films.

Sure! But, there's absolutely nothing wrong with that when it's done with such elegance and supported by great storytelling & acting. Don't get me wrong; I can't argue that there aren't movies out there that seem to try and push social agendas while failing to apply the same care in the script itself, but that's certainly not the case with Black Widow.Opinions are like buttholes, and everyone's got one, but I'm hoping this short review might persuade you to give the film chance. Ignore the haters and unfair criticisms and go enjoy yourself at the cinema again for a positive change of space. Just be warned that this one's a little more on the dark and serious side, so don't expect it to be as kid-friendly as lighter MCU titles like Guardians of the Galaxy or Spider-Man: Homecoming.In summary, Black Widow has a stellar cast, top-notch fight scenes, beautiful special fx and plenty of action with just enough comedic relief to create the perfect recipe for fun.

Her scene with a captured Loki in 'Avengers Assemble' was most intriguing and begged for a spin off film to explore Romanoff's past. Like The Wolverine's solo outing 'Black Widow' doesn't deliver.No where nearly as bad as the X-Men Origins movie but still a flawed piece of story telling and a missed opportunity.'Black Widow' is entertaining and offers some excellent performances by the cast involved. Except perhaps Ray Winstone who's Russian accent drops in and out more often than a dodgy WI-FI connection. Set pieces are grand as you'd expect in a Marvel movie but the end product lacks venom (and I don't mean the Marvel character played by Tom Hardy).There's no depth to this movie. Unlike 'Logan' the redeeming Wolverine movie, 'Black Widow' is all polish and garnish. There's some nice character interaction. The family scenes are comical and well played out but I constantly got the sense that all this had been done before in better movies. The car chase scene was lifted straight from 'Mission Impossible'. The prison break reminded me of 'Deadpool 2' and the falling fortress in the sky was done better in the Captain America sequel.

But a genuinely dark tone that would work perfectly with the dark thematic background of the main character. And the start of the movie made me think they were going that route. It was pretty messed up. But the rest of the movie felt exactly like the template MCU movie. I love that template, but it would have been cool to see something different here.The second thing that could have made it stand out is the musical score. I've complained so many times that the weakest part of the MCU is the music. There are a few scores i like, but most are unimpactful. The new MCU shows have stepped it up (wandavision, falcon winter, and especially loki).When black widow started, i loved the musical score. It was immediately impactful and elevated the prologue. It gave the movie character. And then the credits show that it's composed by lorne balfe, who has become one of my favorite composers. But as usual in the MCU, the music is kept mostly in the background and has very little impact on the scenes. Think of the music played during the final fight in civil war or during the funeral scene in thor 2. The music owns me. And it could have in black widow. But i barely noticed it for the rest of the movie.The action was pretty good but no scenes really stood out. And the execution of the conclusion was a bit messy. And it didn't necessarily hurt the movie, but i was more invested in the characters of yelena and alexei than natasha.I really did enjoy this movie, but it could have been amazing.

It's basically a distaff James Bond with more childhood trauma, but for that it's generally good.Like a lot of MCU movies, Black Widow assumes you've watched all the other movies and remember who everyone is. It seems to also assume we'll understand the little story it tells in the credits, which is more impressionistic than informative. I was pretty much at a loss for the first 1/2 hour.At first this movie felt like I'd already seen it. There's a fight scene on a bridge that I could have sworn I'd already seen, even though the movie just came out, and it really took a while before that sense of Deja Vu ended.At first I wasn't sure if I wanted to keep going, but once the excellent Florence Pugh shows up as the protagonist's sister and the movie starts delving into the nature of family and some moral grey zones things get more interesting. And the final half hour of explosions and twists and hurtling through the sky is impressively action-y, even if no one has x-ray vision.While this movie's insistence on not explaining things to non-MCU fanatics (a practice it returns to in a final coda) and some rote early scenes keep this from being as good as it could have been, overall this is an entertaining movie.

But I won't continue to harp on that...What we find here is a movie with a surprising amount of heart. Johansson and Pugh have great chemistry together on screen - indeed Pugh seems to be a worthy successor of the Black Widow title in future films. They family dynamic that has developed in the film was surprising in a good way, I loved the way each character is shown yearning for something good in their life, only to realize they had it together, for however a brief amount of time it was. One thing I love about Black Widow is she's always seeking redemption for the tough cases and for those around her she cares about, and it pays off here with her family.Is it a great \"Marvel\" movie? No, it's not what it could have been had it been released 4 or 5 years ago and had more involvement from the other main characters. Considering what she's contributed to the franchise as a whole, ScarJo deserved at least a cameo or two from one of the guys.But is it a \"good\" movie? IMO, yes.

What we get here is an action flick on a higher scale. Not as High as say Captain America: The Winter soldier, but that's the level they were reaching for, but never get thereThat has a lot to do with the fact that Black Widow could have done some more action in the action film. In films with other Avengers Black Widow gives a superb action sequence. Some of the sequences here felt incomplete. Too much cutting in-between the action and the talking (not something you want to do in an action film really).There was a lot of talking. A lot of understandable talking, yes, but at the same time I wanted to see Red Guardian do some more Captain America stuff.Not sure how I feel about Florence Pugh. Good as a fellow Black Window. Funny when it comes to poking fun of Natasha Romanoff and her being an Avenger, but the chemistry between Pugh and Johansson did not hold the movie as needed.Ray Winstone's Villainy is a step back (maybe purposely as the movie takes place in the past). Not his fault for his portrayal of General Dreykov, it just that once Marvel reached perfection with Thanos its hard to watch them turn back to only the hero's journey matters and not the foil they face.I was waiting for the Task Master to make it onto the silver screen for a minute. Not what I was expecting but not fully disappointed. Just left me wanting more.I want to point out that this movie is one step up from Captain Marvel. I know it should mean nothing, but there was a very little thing in Black Widow that I was expecting Captain Marvel to be all about.I have to admit though I did love this action movie, but as a Marvel movie I just felt it was missing a lot of parts. It was cool when they referenced things talked about in other movies but then you had things in the movie that needed to be addressed more.Overall, I thought Scarlett Johansson showed a mastery of the character.

The storyline surrounds Black Widow during the Civil War where she takes a hiatus to regroup with her sister and support a mission that they are both pursuing. They decide to break their father out of jail who happens to know the location of the villain's lair. As they work together it quickly becomes apparent why there is so much resentment for each other within the family and why a happy ending isn't likely. This movie is directed by Cate Shortland (Lore) and stars Scarlett Johansson (Jojo Rabbit), Rachel Weisz (The Fountain), William Hurt (A History of Violence), Florence Pugh (Little Women) and David Harbour (The Stranger Things). The family dynamic in this made for an impressive storyline way better than I anticipated. There is a dark cloud over the family the entire movie and doubt if they will ever overcome it...and the conclusion to that element of the movie was very well put together.

It is quite charming and funny.As good as the ensemble is ; this is Scarlett Johansson's movie and she truly delivers , big time ! Black Widow is not only Scarlett Johansson's final outing in the MCU but also her best of the lot. We find Romanoff in unfamiliar territory, on her own and without any form of a support structure. She's vulnerable in a way that we haven't really seen before, something Johansson portrays beautifully. Scarlett Johansson, the charismatic queen of Marvel science fiction.

What we got is a middling Marvel effort with a rehashed spy thriller story and its affiliated action set-pieces and plot clich\u00e9s. Granted, that very spy flavour that bleeds into each act more and more evidently endows us with a couple of slick action sequences that are pulled off with aplomb. It's just unfortunate all of them are devoid of the slightest tension. While on the subject, there's no real sense of danger I feel each time either Natasha or Yelena are supposedly at risk, and The Taskmaster completely fails to prove an imposing threat, that's not to mention it's a villain that's clearly merely skimmed over, with the result of falling victim to the plot's mishmash of clich\u00e9s. The humour isn't the worst, largely due to Pugh and Harbour whose chemistry elevates each scene they share a great deal. The third act feels the most superhero-y, with a fair share of explosions and CGI-heavy scenes that almost feel incongruous with the relatively small-scope MCU installment Black Widow aims to be. However, It's also here when we get some emotionally-charged moments where Pugh - yup, once again - and Scarlett get there moments to shine, serving a fitting send-off for our titular superhero.

Black widow was the worst character in the movie. The Marvel-element was shoe-horned into the movie by forced dialogue rather than actual cameos or plot points, it seems. It comes across as mediocre at best.___\nThe characters surrounding Black Widow are actually pretty likeable. Her sisters personality is, by far, more human and relatable than Black Widow herself. Funny, capable and witty. Her father is the sorely needed steretotype driving marvels comic relief, I guess. Her mother was, if nothing else, somewhat interesting occasionally (But with an oversimplified and nonsensical cookie-cutter plotline).Yet most things driving the narrative relates to black widow, which is a shame. Her character is by far the least colorful of the bunch, and most of her dialogue sounds like words of a soon-to-be-converted bleeding heart idealist rather than a trained double agent with a dark past. Instead of dealing with the grey areas and moral dilemmas a spys life contains, it is a continous appeal to emotion and family. Her sister would have been a better protagonist, honestly. As an R-rated noir movie, this could have been a smash hit.SO many of the plot points are just lazy. Anti-mind control chemicals? The evil mastermind revealing the grand plan in detail? Pheromonal locks? An air fortress? Come on... (and why didn't she break her nose before the hormonal lock situation anyways, when she was fully aware of it in advance?)To compensate for shortcomings like this, grand action scenes and super powers followed by humor could lighten up the mood. But even as a hero, Black Widow seems underwhelming, as thousands of widows seems almost as competent and Taskmaster completly pulverizes her. She is just one of many. And with very little time for any emotional development, it is hard to find a reason to get invested in her, specifically. The action scenes seem like a fast and furious film rather than a marvel film, with quick cuts, shaky cams and limited visibility. To save money, maybe?Which leads us onto the next point: It seemed underfunded, as they felt the need to talk about the avengers ALL the time but not including any of the heros (or villains) in a single scene. The Marvel-element was shoe-horned into it, it seems.In summary, a pointless cashgrab with non of the limitless potential it had utilized. I am not saying it is the worst, but it isn't good. And it could have been! Such a shame."}, {"reviewer_name": "feyipuk", "date": "14 July 2021", "text": "Taking place first in her preteen life and then between Civil War and Infinity War (with some other flash backs in between) the film tries to fill in some plot holes for those time periods the other films haven't, while seeming to set up Natashas replacement, given we know her fate in Endgame.Compared to other MCU films this is a lot more hand to hand, as befitting the Widows way of fighting. Iron Man presses a button and the bad guys fall down, here it's more like a series of dance moves showing off their amazing training, and there are some well choreographed interactions.It sadly doesn't pull off the same level of comedy as Ragnarok; Red Guardian is just a buffoon in comparison to Korg and Co, while Natashas fixer seems to spend much of his screen time asleep, but it has some good lines that keeps it moving along at a good speed.Prequels are tricky for a series character; you can explore extra details to their lives - such as Natasha talking a bit more about her history with Clint - but ultimately they have to end in a situation that links to something that's been filmed before. You can't have a character die in a prequel, when you know they're alive in a previous film that takes place later in the characters timeline (unless the future character is actually a clone or has some other subtle change made to them). This does seem to reduce the risk to life here - Yelena is listed in the Hawkeye series - though in what capacity this Widow will take is still to be decided."}, {"reviewer_name": "ajikude", "date": "14 July 2021", "text": "Much better than expected.

That just lost it for me and felt pointlessly out of place to her character and the adventure up to that point.I suppose the fight between the Red Gusrdian and Task Master was a let down, he is this super strong super solider yet he just stumbled through their fight? Was that a dig at Russia perhaps? Who knows besides the writers, but it was another plop in the plot.All things considered, we got what we came for and felt the movie was fun and theater worthy.

In my theater pretty much all the comedy was a miss, it felt like they were going for a darker tone in this movie, which I was down for, but they constantly cut it down with humor that just wasn't hitting. The action was jittery and janky, I expect better from a huge company like Marvel at this point. For example the fight between Red Guardian and Taskmaster in the trailer looked awesome, but in the movie they constantly cut to other characters and you never got to see just pure uninterrupted action. Actually you did but it was Fast and Furious 9 levels of ridiculousness. The villains are TERRIBLE.

I have no problem with Marvel taking liberties with Taskmasters origin and making the character a female but the character was almost an afterthought. There was one point in the movie where Taskmaster shows up and I thought \"oh yeah, I forgot Taskmaster was in this movie\".

I have read some incredibly vitreolic reviews and am floored by them -- just exactly what is it that has made them so angry? It is beyond my understanding.

The script is a bit light-weight and quippey, especially when Romanov's father shows up, which makes some of the 'family bonding' scenes a bit uneven, but the two 'sisters' seem to have fun with their roles (Florence Pugh is quite good as Yelena). The opening sequence and credits are excellent as is much of the first half but the film falters somewhat when the action moves to the villain's improbable aerial secret-base and resorts to the much parodied shtick of the evil-doer carefully explaining his nefarious plans before an overly-long and physics-defying climatic fight.

Somehow the family is under control by a madman who simply controls people's free will. Which is known as the Red Room. For me, I find it dark and disturbing. Especially when it deals with children, manipulations, and having power to control the world.Black Widow wants revenge, however Taskmaster gets in the way. Her family has some dark secrets.

It was loaded with action and reminded me a lot of The Winter Soldier, my favorite Marvel film. The chemistry between Scartlett Johansen and Florence Pugh was great.The film moved slowly at first, but Black Widow never had a proper origin story in the Marvel movies, so taken the time to know her character, was necessary. It's too bad we won't get to see more of her character in follow up movies, but I do believe Florence Pugh as Yelena will be perfect as the new Black Widow. She was amazing in this movie.The family dynamic between Yelena, Natasha, Alexi, and Melina was also very good. I did very much enjoy the twist towards the end which made use of technology used by Natasha in Winter Soldier.

It's an interesting backstory mixed with spy capers, a dysfunctional family comedy, and some hard-hitting action. The superhero action flick is directed by a woman, Cate Shortland.THINGS I LIKED:\nI'm so happy for Scarlett Johansson for finally getting her own feature film. This movie fleshes out her character with an interesting backstory that makes for an entertaining and touching solo Avenger movie. Unfortunately, this will probably be her last one since her character has already died in the MCU died in the story arc!Florence Pugh is stellar in this movie as Scarlett Johansson's sister! She has been putting out some great work lately and has an incredibly bright future. She has the athleticism, beauty, and fierceness to be an excellent Yelena. I'm such a fan. The subtleties in her facial expressions and Russian accent made her the true acting standout in this movie. She's also the one who has the most connected relationships with the other characters in the story and brings real heart to the movie. Her character has a full arc demonstrating her toughness and vulnerability. She should definitely be added to the MCU.David Harbour is absolutely fantastic and one of the highlights of the movie. I love his endearing obsession with Captain America. I get it. I do too. One of my favorite scenes of his is when he's in a room having a heart-to-heart with Yelena (Florence Pugh's character).There are quite a few action sequences and entertaining moments I can't wait to see again already.When is Rachel Weisz going to start aging? She looks great.Great cat fight scene between the sisters, but the Taskmaster fight sequences were electric. Taskmaster's presence instantly darkened the tone and made it feel like a superhero movie. Kudos to the stunt team because the sequences hit HARD.The opening credits are striking and kind of different for a Marvel movie.I thought the \"Avengers posing\" conversation between the sisters was pretty funny.Sweet firefly moments. They're so magical.The comedic banter works most of the time.There are a few Easter eggs for true Marvel fans.Some critics have pointed out that Natasha spends Act 1 hiding. The more I thought about it, the more I thought that was appropriate since actual black widow spiders do the same. Then, when the prey is in sight, they pounce and kill.So many Russian braids. Ha ha\nIt has the elements of a spy movie with double-crosses and alliances, making some film critics call it a Marvel version of a James Bond movie.As with all Marvel movies, keep watching after the final rolling credits for another clip, a fun cameo, and an intriguing teaser!THINGS I DIDN'T LIKE:\nThere are a LOT of quiet, talking moments. Some of them are touching but because of them, Act 3 feels rushed.The CGI and stunt doubles are often very noticeable.It's so sad that there wasn't a Stan Lee moment in this Marvel movie.I would have loved an even stronger Russian influence.It takes about 40 minutes to set up the actual plot.There are several times when you'll laugh and say, \"Come on!\" when certain people miraculously survive ridiculously deadly moments.The actual villain doesn't show up for a very long time. He's disappointingly bland.TIPS FOR PARENTS:\nSome profanity.Gross conversation about a forced hysterectomy\nLots of destruction\nViolence with only a tiny bit of blood even though it's brutal.Some subtitles when Russian is spoken.You can see the rest of my review on my Movie Review Mom YouTube channel!"}, {"reviewer_name": "rikaros", "date": "13 July 2021", "text": "This film is totally useless.

Except for Hawkeye, she was the only one from that OG Avengers team who hadn't got a movie dedicated to them hitherto. Having said that, I'm afraid it's not what we've been waiting for.Right from the beginning, I was noticing some incongruities in its narrative disposition. Which appeared to have an acute scarcity in terms of consistency and integrality. While it did have subtexts regarding Misogyny, Male Chauvinism, and all the other stuff of social relevance; the Screenplay bristled with its own quandaries had not been able to generate acceptable outcomes I reckon!I volitionally got myself invested in all this whacky family drama at the early stages in hopes of getting onto something more substantial. However; down the line in a quite befuddling manner, things started to get redundant and unimaginative! Only then I realized, this is not going to work out. Superficial character depictions and Incompetent Writing; these two main factors are to be blamed for. As a consequence; the entire narration fell flat and was unable to capitalize on the sentimental sides of the storyline.Such a constrictive way of storytelling reigns supreme anytime there's a bit of action going. Chase sequences, Fist Fights, Guns, Explosions, quick-witted Humor; all very conventional Marvel stuff but that's when it achieves the most. Not to mention, it has largely benefited from a bunch of impressive visual effects (for the most part) and a stimulating Score along the same lines.Speaking of Performances; Scarlett Johansson as the leading protagonist did the best she could, as expected. She's been consistently doing the same for years now, so no real surprise there. David Harbour and Rachel Weisz were welcome additions but they were gravely underutilized, serviceable at best. The standout was definitely Florence Pugh; without a doubt! I strongly believe her portrayal of Yelena soon gonna end up being a fan favorite.At the end of the day; I just wanna ask, is this even relevant at this point? As we are all aware of the fact that they have already eradicated the character of Black Widow from their Cinematic Universe. Therefore, she won't be playing any part in the next phase (Phase IV) whatsoever! So, Why now? Why not a couple of years back?

I truly don't think so.If they had made this into a 4 - 8 Part show on Disney plus i wouldn probably say: \"Ok, its not worse than \"The Falcon and the Winter Soldier\", but also not better.\"\nBut as a Movie it just falls short for me as it is."}, {"reviewer_name": "rkbblogger", "date": "7 July 2021", "text": "I really enjoyed this movie I saw it at an early screening last night I highly recommend you watch it but keep your expectations at mind that it's not including the big three \"wizards aliens and androids lol\" the film however suffers from a slight Villian problem which is rather lack luster and underwhelming however the performances and action set pieces will leave you exiting your theatre with a happy smile on your face,also don't forget to wait for a cheeky post credit scene hinting at the inclusion of a characters story in one of the upcoming Disney plus shows !!!

A shame considering the groundwork leading up to it.Final Say -The first Marvel film in many a moon is more of the same solid stuff from a company that has perfected its offering into a finely tuned machine, Black Widow isn't necessary or groundbreaking but its a winner for comic book fans and those seeking quality made blockbuster entertainment.3 1/2 mind controlled pigs out of 5."}, {"reviewer_name": "jens-andree", "date": "15 July 2021", "text": "I had high hopes for Black Widow to be a movie on the same level - script, acting, action, grandeur - as the early Marvel movies.

Really poor acting - or directing, whatever's at fault?Me and my kids have watched all of the Marvel movies up to the final Avengers time and time and time again - which is a true testament to great movies, but Black Widow is a movie I'll never watch again, which is a shame because I really love Scarlet Johansson when she's really into a role! This was a real \"meh\" moment...I'd hoped Rachel Weisz and Olga Kurylenko would have great parts and really lift the movie but one of them seemed sleeping and the other only showed her face twice - and only had one tiny line...\nThe only one at least trying to deliver was Florence Pugh - which is obviously set to return in a spinoff.I'm putting this Marvel film in the same bucket as most of the newer ones, you know the extra bucket for milking that cow dry to the bone, hoping the connection to the original Avenger movies will be enough to print more money, but I'm getting more and more fed up with how these new Marvel movies are made and gone are the good unique superhero movies, replaced with some cookie cutter - often feminist - replacements, and not good ones either.Your mileage might vary and I've seen reviews ranging from nil to max so please make up your own mind about Black Widow, but it's a Marvel movie I'd gladly had missed despite loving Scarlet Johansson as an actor because she can be really great with a good script and a good director!I know Jon Favreau is super busy and can't make everything himself, but if Marvel is going to continue making awesome movies we need him behind the reigns, or Taika Waititi for doing comedy variants, which I gather this one tried to be and failed so hard...P.s.

Black Widow is a great return to marvel movies after a two year hiatus and is exciting and engaging throughout the whole two and a half hours. Scarlett Johansson is still incredible as Natasha, but the show gets stolen by Florence Pugh's Yelena. The relationship between the two sisters is one of the many joys of this movie and Yelena's witty sarcastic comments provide hilarious breaks between the action and more heavy themes of the movie. An hugely entertaining movie for the entire 2 and a half hours, it definitely stands out as one of the best solo films to date. Don't listen to the reviews calling it overly feminist- just because a movie has women in it doesn't mean that it's pandering to any agenda. Just because there are powerful women doesn't mean it's tokenistic or over the top.

CGI was rough towards the end but mostly it was great.Coming to the story, I liked the plot. They were doing so good setting up the challenges unfortunately the solutions which they apply they messed up. Bit of lazy writing there. Yes Taskmaster is different from comic but it was fine for me. They shouldn't have included that character in this kind of movie. But they did and utilized best they could.Anyway, I am not going to cry like a little boy because they didn't do justice to comics. As a movie this was great. It was less of a Black Widow send off and more of a Yelena setup. I had hoped Barton would be there in a Black Widow movie but they don't have to do what I expected. I am matured enough to watch a movie not based on what I wanted but whether what they have given is great and entertaining or not."}, {"reviewer_name": "clashofclansatt", "date": "13 July 2021", "text": "I can't describe how much i'm disappointing while see this movie.."}, {"reviewer_name": "c-26924", "date": "13 July 2021", "text": "Terrible acting, terrible plot and real waste of time."}, {"reviewer_name": "chinmayarawat", "date": "13 July 2021", "text": "Films like this recieving negative reviews is the very reason why production houses don't invest in female-centric movies and instead, push woke films.This isn't a Ghostbusters or Ocean's reboot but a genuine attempt at telling a good story, with a woman in the front.

But since Marvel took so long to develop this film, audiences finally get their Black Widow solo movie far too late, after we already know the fate of the character. Regardless, this is a perfectly entertaining addition to the Marvel Cinematic Universe, but it could have been so much more. The film is at its best when it is focused on its characters and the performances of the actors, and when it tries to be a spy thriller rather than just another big-budget MCU tentpole.The best parts of this movie all involve either Florence Pugh or David Harbour, who play the sister and father of Natasha Romanoff (Black Widow). They both give charismatic performances that supercede some of the more generic aspects of the plot. The stunt work is also quite fantastic for much of the movie, especially in the first two-thirds. A car chase scene and a sister-to-sister fight scene are both choreographed excellently and are thrilling from start to finish.For the first two acts of BLACK WIDOW, I was invested in the storyline and was thoroughly enjoying myself due to the action and the different approach on a Marvel film. However, the final act reverts back to the absolute ridiculousness that Hollywood money-makers such as this are known for, and the movie lost me at that point. Once the characters arrive to the location for the emotional climax and final major CGI fight scene, the writing becomes annoyingly trite and boring, and the action becomes overblown and mind-numbing. I even ceased to be invested in the story and character arcs, and stopped caring at all about how the movie concludes.BLACK WIDOW may be another watchable action movie from Marvel, but at this point they need to turn things up a notch and deliver something truly different. This film will not be regularly talked about in a year's time, and Disney/Marvel needs to start making more movies that stick in viewers' brains more than just another sci-fi CGI fight scene.

It was impossible to follow.Black Widow is not very interesting, and most of the best lines come from her sister (Florence Pugh), and her father, the Red Guardian (David Harbour). The comic book version of Red Guardian was totally tough super-soldier, but in the movie he is just a fat has-been, like Thor in the last Avengers Endgame movie. Harbour is mostly around for comedy, but he is a good actor, and makes his role interesting.Rachel Weisz plays the Black Widow's mother, and it is a pretty generic performance. The story is really odd, as Weisz is the brains of the Russian spy system but she is on a farm doing brain control experiments on pigs.The main Russian spy master was a very generic Russian character talking about world domination and power. He could have been from SPECTRE. The guy reminded me of Blofeld, and several other SPECTRE leaders from past James Bond movies.TaskMaster was a very unique and interesting character in the comic books, and he is totally destroyed as a character in this movie. His entire back-story, character, and everything about TaskMaster is changed, and not for the better.This movie takes place after Captain America: Civil War, and before the Avengers versus Thanos movies.

Then we move to the movie itself, the Civil War bit was entertaining and made sense since the movie takes place right after Civil War.Now lets get to the characters, Natasha for some reason seems very different than the way she was in any of the other movies, she always reminds herself and the audience that she was an Avenger and the other characters didn't help, the movie might as well had been called \"The Ex Avenger\" since it was mentioned more time than the fact she was a spy or that she's the Black Widow or the Villain. Speaking of, the Villain was awful and the Red Room was incredibly disappointing, I can only remember the names of 5 characters of the movie and one of those I can only remember their Super villain name \"task master\", her identity was really disappointing, I honestly enjoyed Captain Marvel several times more than any of the characters in this movie, that's including Natasha.The plot was predictable the lines sarcasm and lines were predictable as well. The only reason I'm giving this movie a 5 is because of the acting, with %40 of the movie being an awful plot %10 of the stuff being out of place and %50 being good acting that's my score for the movie.

The film takes place between \"Captain America: Civil War\" and \"Avengers: Infinity War\"; audiences get more of the backstory of Natasha Romanoff (Scarlett Johansson), as we are introduced to her early life before the Red Room.This is not to say that the film is an origin story as it uses her backstory through a clever introduction that establishes her \"family\" as sleeper agents in Ohio before they escape and she and her cover sister are tuned over for conditioning and training.Since Natasha is on the run from the authorities; she finds a remote location in Norway to bide her time. This does not last as a dangerous adversary known as the Taskmaster arrives and sets a chain of events into motion.Natasha has been sent a package from her cover sister Yelena (Florence Pugh) who also went through the Red Room and became a top assassin in the years since she and Natasha last saw one another.Despite her mixed feelings; Natasha ventures to Budapest and confronts Yelena who in turn reveals the package she sent her contains a compound that can free the other Black Widows from the control of the Red Room which despite Natasha's insistence is still very much alive as is the head of the institute which she is convinced she killed long ago.With Taskmaster and other Widows hot on their trail, Natasha and Yelena are forced to seek the help of their former \"Father\" the imprisoned hero Red Guardian (David Harbour), and their cover Mother Melina (Rachel Weisz), to find the location of the new Red Room; free the Widows, and end the program once and for all.What follows is an engaging story with solid action and effects that remains at its core a character story as Natasha attempts to reconcile her cover family with her new Avengers family and the pain of her upbringing and conditioning.Marvel resisted calls from some to release the film on Disney+ last year when the Pandemic caused multiple delays to the planned release dates. This decision to me was very wise as this is a film that needs to be seen and heard on the big screen as it is an experience that is best experienced in a cinema with others.While many attempts were made over the decades to adapt comic heroes to film and television; most of them came up lacking and disappointed fans of the source material. Marvel for over a decade has continued to succeed as they have a clear plan, cast well, and have engaging characters that develop over time.\"Black Widow\" fills in a missing gap of time in the MCU well and also sets up future adventures as a scene in the credits clearly links two of the live-action Disney+ series and shows that the long-term plan for the MCU continues and incorporates the film and television series well.From the moment the Marvel intro and music appeared on the screen until the very end; \"Black Widow\" was a very enjoyable and engaging blockbuster adventure that shows Marvel at the top of their game; and why they continue to set event-level movies not to miss.4 stars out of 5."}, {"reviewer_name": "Calicodreamin", "date": "9 July 2021", "text": "Florence Pugh carried this movie, her and David Harbour laid down some seriously good comedic moments.

That the actresses are 'lazy' and that the men were better actors (huh... I wonder what they're really trying to say).I've heard people say the plot wasn't good enough for a Black Widow send off; for some of those people they might genuinely believe that, but for others it's a thin veil to disguise their dislike of a female-driven movie. And, honestly, neither of them really understand this movie.This could not have been a better send off to Natasha. Admittedly, the action sequences were not as polished as Captain America: The Winter Soldier's, but that's an incredibly high bar. Black Widow's CGI was no worse that Infinity War or Endgame's! It was believable enough to be good and to have me thoroughly engrossed and impressed. It was a LOT of fun and each of the characters had moments to shine as absolute bad asses (Natasha in particular).The humour was entertaining and genuinely had me laughing (if you have siblings you'll totally understand) and the found family trope was actually very well done (definitely better than the limp attempts made by Whedon and the Russo brothers). In Whedon's Avengers they'd barely had time to feel like a family before he and the Russos started ripping them apart. With Black Widow, to avoid spoilers, all I'll say is that there was tension and the characters were complex and flawed but the film doesn't forget what its main themes are. I loved it.As for the plot? Again, to avoid spoilers I'll be vague: if you're a woman, I'm sure you'll agree with me that the villain is an absolutely vile creature. Both terrifying and, for many of us, so very real.If you know and understand Natasha Romanoff as a character at all, you'd understand that this movie, this mission, is the most important and most *personal* one she's ever been on (bar the one in Endgame, of course).And don't listen to the criticisms about Yelena. She's perfect. She does an excellent job of being the device that propels Natasha's plot and at the same time she's a fantastic character. They all are, to be honest.Of course there were some minor flaws, but show me a single action movie - or any movie for that matter - which doesn't have a few niggles here and there. Overall, this was a great way to say goodbye to my favourite Avenger and I for one, finished the movie feeling thoroughly entertained (and I haven't stopped thinking about it since).Don't listen to the haters.

There is a lot of fun to be had here. This is the only Marvel film that had some good jokes and made me chuckle which is incredibly rare for a Marvel film. Florence Pugh and David Harbour bring a lot of great comedic timing to their performances that definitely elevates them from boring sidekicks. Their characters are actually interesting and feel much more involved in the story. I hope we get to see those two in the future again. Although their Russian accents do need a little bit of work. Scarlett Johansson is good. Her performance is fine. She doesn't do a bad job but there is a lot to be desired especially considering this is her final appearance in the MCU (film wise not timeline wise). Rachel Weisz was fine as well but her character felt very forgettable and bland which sucks because she just falls into the background whenever other characters show up on screen. The main villain is absolutely awful. It's honestly a contender for worst MCU villain. His motivations are almost nonexistent and he exists only to yell and exposit. The characters build up that he'll be hard to kill but he just kinda dies without the influence of the characters which really defeats the purpose of them mentioning how hard he is to kill. Taskmaster is an interesting side villain but ultimately contributes nothing to the plot except as closure for Black Widow's forgettable side mission. The action scenes are kinda bland. If this was an earlier MCU film it would feel a lot better but because the MCU has bumped out some great action scenes, this just feels flat and boring. The visual effects are really spotty. Sometimes they look good and sometimes they look really really bad but the visual effects are usually pretty good. The story is very forgettable. It revolves around Black Widow taking down the Red Room again but the sequence of events is so bland and forgettable. I can't remember some sequence of events relating to the story. It was nice to hear a little bit more about the Budapest adventure but it makes me wish we had got that movie instead of this.

It's true that Scarlett Johansson long ago earned the right to have her own entry in the MCU, but the franchise could have gone on just fine had this film never been created.David Harbour feels out of place as a washed up Soviet superhuman (not so much a superhero) and Rachel Weisz clearly did not show up for this gig to earn a shot at an Academy Award. The one bright spot is Florence Pugh's Yelena Belova, who manages to consistently nail a tricky Russian accent while effortlessly toggling between comedic one-liners and tough as nails action sequences.Save for a few impressive scenes, 'Widow' is pretty dull and doesn't feature any real fan favorites, especially compared to some of the better received Marvel entries of late. It's also clear that Disney had to scrounge around in the couch cushions to find enough pennies to pull this together - it just as well could have been turned into a miniseries on Disney+ given its quality.Lacking originality and coming so long after so many other films, 'Black Widow' is surely one of the lower tier installments in the MCU library.

Not a bad thing, by any means, but it would've been cool to see this movie kinda take the trend of Ant-Man and be a different breed of MCU movie.

Also, while it was cool to see Taskmaster used in the MCU, that character felt very underutilized. Those are really my only two critiques.I've always loved Scar Jo as Black Widow, but Florence Pugh smashed this role out of the park and seeing her in the MCU makes my heart happy (she is forever my May Queen). David Harbour was also very good and sorta acts as the comic relief, alongside Florence. It was also very nice to see Rachel Weisz back in a major movie (I loved her in The Mummy and The Mummy Returns, so seeing her in a badass role like this was almost nostalgic for me).All in all, this might be my favorite SOLO Marvel film since Thor Rangnarok (if that counts) or Black Panther (if Ragnarok doesn't count).Black Widow finally got her solo film and Marvel did her justice.

The problem was the villains: Taskmaster who was marketed heavily as being the main antagonist turned out to be nothing more than a Winter Soldier knockoff with very little screen time. And the reveal of her true identity was very predictable after the Budapest flashback. The real main villain was so unimportant and uninteresting that I can't even remember his name but he was basically hiding in a flying fortress influencing world events with his spies and assassins from the shadows (which seems like a very overplayed plot point as it has already been used in The Winter Soldier with Hydra). Natasha's 'family' were a great addition, but I wish Red Guardian got an action scene where he wasn't just getting shot or beat up. There weren't really any stakes in this movie as the Red Room had supposedly been operating throughout the entire MCU and hadn't caused any real trouble. There were no heroic sacrifices or deaths of any of her 'family' which left little room for any character development that Natasha might have undergone in her own movie which is quite disappointing as this is the last time we will see her. The post-credit scene shows how unimportant this movie is in the grand scheme of the MCU when all it does is set up the Disney + Hawkeye show.

And by that I mean it's not mind-blowing.. but it's not bad. And it's certainly better than just \"good\". If you've read most Marvel comic books, then this is like one of many average side stories they make throughout the year that are a good read. A good comparison would be the \"prelude\" comics they make for the movies. People can just ignore them and they would be fine! Or they can read them, and still feel unprepared and unimpressed.Nevertheless, it has great choreographies, excellent portrayal of character emotions (both Scarlett and Florence are very good on their roles), and a premise that's a bit overblown. It feels structurally weird for a movie, somethings aren't paid off enough and just are, but it's not as bad as a Captain Marvel.. though it lacks in importance as well, and doesn't build anything on top of what we already have (specially not for Natasha). You could skip it without issues.I'm also not a fan of the treatment the Ghost character received in Ant-Man 2. Sadly, Task Master is adapted similarly.

Natie fights her Sister Yelena brutally but WHY?4. Natie falls of a 4 story building but she's just fine WHY? Kinda makes you think why she didnt survive the fall in EndGame.5. A long car chase ensues where Nat and Yelena is involved in a brutal motorcycle accident but both are just fine.6. They then get into a horrific car accident but their just fine minor scratches. So by this time im convinced they are both Super Humans.7. All men in this movie is either evil or really stupid and gets put down the hole time.8.

A movie that works without any knowledge of what has gone on before or what will happen next? I would argue that it can work. Of course having some knowledge of the timeline is not a bad thing to have. And while this starts off before other big events, it mainly plays between Civil War (which was an Captain America movie, even though all the Avengers were in it) and Infinity War.And it sort of literally closes a gap and gives us more Black Widow. Yes this movie was something a lot of people wanted to see a long time ago. But the way they put and the story they are telling - it works quite fine. It is more of spy thriller kind of thing rather than a superhero movie (a lot of superhero kind of stuff still happens) - there is even a clip on the telly (TV) showing us James Bond.But amongst all the action and all the frenzy and all the becoming or growing as a character (Black Widow but also her allies), there is a lot of family stuff happening. Which is funny, considering that the family thing is a front. Now I am not alone in saying that this is an allegory not just on family life but the American (way of) Life. And while the addition of the American Pie song might have been an ad lib or last minute addition, it sums it up really good in more than one way. And just when you least expect it, the song also might get a tear out of you. Or at least make you sentimental.The performances are great and the way a big machine like Marvel still allows performers to do and bring their own ideas shows on screen. The chemistry between the characters and the fun they are having on set. And then there are pigs - a friend was reminded of Bullets of Justice ... I have to admit, this could work as a prequel to that too (this is a violent movie, do not seek it out if you are easily offended and squeamish).All that aside, yes there are ridiculous things happening, yes many things are removed from reality, but it has quite the courage to go places, that you may not expect - for a Marvel movie and all that. And when towards the end ... well a certain piece of music/theme is playing ... if you have been a fan of the Avengers universe and the movies before, you will get emotional. I can guarantee you that.And as always there is something in the credits.

I really like how this film felt like a spy movie and less than a super hero movie. There were a few cheesy shots of explosions that did have my eyes rolling. Yet, it did a really good job telling untold characteristics of Natasha's character, why does she really became an Avenger, and the whole Red Room organization was well crafted. Yes, the fact that it is known that this film takes place between Captain America: Civil War and Avengers: Infinity War, it does reduce the sense of stakes in the story since we know Natasha will come out alive no matter what.Talking about other characters, besides Scarlett Johansson still killing it as Black Window, the person who will probably will steal the show for most audiences will be Florence Pugh character \"Yelena Belova.\" At this rate, it looks like Phase 4 of the MCU is taking an aim for the next generation of heroes who will take on the next Thanos; Sam becoming the new Captain America, Spider-man the next big hero like Iron Man, Scarlett Witch will probably will have something for Doctor Strange in the sequel, Mataie Portman will become the next Thor, and Yelena will be the next Black Widow; We'll see. There is an after-credit scene at the end. Rachel Weisz and David Harbour characters brought that sense of family in the story and were more the comic reliefs for the movie, but the chemistry between the actors and characters worked great in my opinion.Now, lets talk about the elephant in the room and my believe as why a lot of people are hating this movie. This is where SPOILERS get serious. Taskmaster. I will say, I like what they did with the character. The fighting style is the same as the comics, SHE studies her opponents, mimics their movements and find weaknesses to oppose them. Yes, Taskmaster in the film is a female not a male like in the comics. And yes, Taskmaster is only in the film for like 5-7 minutes of screen time, and she is not the main villain. Taskmaster is the character to clean up the bad guys mess a.k.a the minion. I believe that there was a lot of hype for Taskmaster since the marketing for this movie sold Taskmaster as the big threat of the story, which she kind of is and at the same time not. What did I like about the character? The connection and the reveal on who she was. Especially it set-up more menace to the main villain of the story, and more reason why Natasha, one of many Black Windows, is considered a hero. And the villain in the story actually works great, he has a personal backstory with Natasha that really tells a movie that does feel like a story that needed to be told, and not one made just for money.This is a great movie and a great send off to one of the original Avengers. This movie is meant to see on the big screen and not on TV. Like 97% of all movies based on literature works, this just influence on some aspects of the comic books and creates its own story. I am not much of a comic book guy, never read anything outside Spider-man, Batman, or Superman. This movie is great, and the MCU has done a lot of changes and we now know that we can expect a great set up for the upcoming future. Yes, there is a potential for a Black Widow 2 or for material left in this movie to be explore later in the cinematic universe. My recommendation, don't go see a movie with a mind set that they will make a page by page film from a book that everyone will know how its going to end."}, {"reviewer_name": "TheProteanGirl", "date": "14 July 2021", "text": "A this point superhero movies need to find something unique to go on (which is much easier said than done) because it's becoming really formulaic. Personally, it was a Marvel movie which you could swap the name with another and no one would know, there wasn't much uniqueness to. The CGI in my opinion was badly done, looked choppy and rushed. The characters were all female, not a single man other than David Harbour who in my opinion portrayed a Russian the best out of them all but whose onoy role was a comic relief character and not an actual standalone hero or villain to fight. I get they want to empower women and all that but this isn't how you do it. In all honesty, they are laughing at women in my opinion because if you need a movie with only all women to empower them then this is not representative of real life. If we get a movie of all women then men should get one too. The whole ending seemed like a way to shove the whole \"liberate yourselves women\" in people's face, it's just so blatant and unsubtle it makes you cringe. I'm a woman and I was rolling my eyes at these scenes. Scarlet Johansen didn't even seem like the main character of this movie tbh. Also, lack of action, I was getting bored.

Sure, it did have its very minimal flaws, but in my opinion, it had more pros. The one thing I really liked was the family dynamics in the movie. Even though non of them are related, they all acted like a family in the funny, dysfunctional way most families do. A great example of that was the scene where they were eating dinner together after reuniting, it was hilarious. I also liked the bantering sibling rivalry Natasha and Yelena had, that was also very funny and reminded me of how I act with my sibling. I also though the supporting cast in this movie was some of the best in the MCU. I loved hearing all of them with their Russian accents. David Harbor was hilarious, I couldn't stop laughing at his scenes, Rachel Weisz was also great, but Florence Pugh stole the show, she was amazing, I can't wait to see what her future holds in the MCU. Another pro this movie had was its action. It was amazing. The fight scenes we some of the best in the MCU. This is my personal opinion, but I liked how this followed Civil War, and ended before Infinity War. This movie did a great job filling the gap in Natasha's story between those movies. This movies was also unique in a way. Almost every Marvel movie has cool animated closing credits at the end of the movie before the credits role. This movie did not, instead they decided to do something that hasn't been done since The Incredible Hulk and Iron Man 2 did it. They had opening credits. I had goosebumps watching the opening credits in this movie. It was so good, I didn't feel like I was watching a Marvel movie, I felt like I was watching a war movie. The way they made it look so real was breathtaking, it was definitely one of the stronger points of the movie, it was also important to the story. The last thing I liked about this film was Ray Winstone's portrayal of Dreykov. The character is so truly evil, and the role was played to perfection. The one con to this movie was that it was a little slow, but other than that, it was great.All in all, I am just happy Marvel movies are back, but sadly, theaters aren't open in my area so I couldn't get the true experience. I don't know anything about Taskmaster, so I can't comment on why people hate what happened so much, but I thought Taskmaster was very cool.

Usually, Marvel's action scenes have little weight, seeing as almost nobody dies (or visibly runs the risk), and so when even someone bland and disposable like Quicksilver gets axed, fangirls will start a petition to revive him (yes, this seriously happened).You can imagine, then, the tears that came when Avengers: Infinity War dropped and its villain proved to be a serious threat, only to have most of his victims return by the time we got Avengers: Endgame. Even their worst and most heartbreaking wasn't too bad.However, one death that still meant something was that of Natasha \"Black Widow\" Romanoff (Scarlett Johansson) in the latter production, likewise that of Tony Stark, so what must we do to help the fanboys cope? Simple: include her in a midquel set after Civil War, featuring bit characters that are absent and unmentioned by the time Infinity War's plot comes along. The MCU canon has always seemed remarkably well-thought-out, but as proven by Captain Marvel, it gets tricky when they start adding major events \"in the middle\". Some of you already know what I think of Loki and TFATWS but let's focus on just the movies for now.The plot: after the events of Civil War, self-exiled Avenger and former S. H. I. E. L. D. agent Natasha Romanoff finds that her troubled past in the KGB (briefly alluded to in Age of Ultron) is catching up with her, as she reconnects with other \"Black Widows\" (Florence Pugh as her adoptive sister; Rachel Weisz as her adoptive mother) and The Red Guardian (David Harbour), Russia's equivalent to Captain America. There's also Natasha's former S. H. I. E. L. D. colleague, played by O-T Fagbenle - a name I am not 100% sure I'm actually allowed to say.I liked the prologue more than anything else. We see younger versions of both Natasha and Yelena (the Pugh character, whose younger self looks more like the Johansson character and vice versa) as their Black Widow lives truly, hauntingly begin. The subsequent credits montage is a visual feast (though the spooky lullaby cover of Nirvana's \"Smells Like Teen Spirit\" won't be universally loved) and nothing else in the film compares to it.Still, this long-overdue solo adventure is occasionally gripping - and uses its classic spy-movie tropes charmingly, even if some concepts are too dumb for even Austin Powers - but considering how wild and \"out there\" the rest of MCU Phase Four is getting (with multiverses, Time Keepers, et al.), this comparatively vanilla comic-book movie may be too little too late for most geeks, barring the hardcore Black Widow fans. Some of it gets pretty dark, then punctuated (and deflated) by the typical MCU comedy, which gets way worse halfway through. The effects and shoddy greenscreens won't be a huge draw either. All of this is a shame, considering this is the first proper MCU film release since 2019.Disney, along with the usual journalists, have admittedly done their best to generate juicy PR. There was a fruitful attempt to get a rise out of angry nerds with articles about how men will be \"put in their place\" by this movie and outright squeam (sic) at the sight of women kicking ass, which the other side was naturally meant to laud as the most empowering thing since Ghostbusters, Ocean's 8, and the all-female reboot of Die Zombiej\u00e4ger that I just decided to make.But people are getting smarter, at least when it comes to films like Charlie's Angels, Wonder Woman 1984, and now this. Even Twitter feminists can see through the narrative that these movies were hated purely because they star/celebrate women. Bad movies are bad movies, no matter what the message is (or pretends to be) or whom you can spite by supporting it. Yes, some dudebros still got mad at the article, but even then, many of them just seemed weary of the same old spiel and how transparent it's getting. While I'm sure Disney coaxed one or two angry videos out of The Quartering and Geeks+Gamers, fighting like toddlers over big-studio cinema just isn't what it used to be.The movie itself is, simply put, pretty lame. It isn't outlandish enough to compete with the rest of the Phase Four media and it doesn't even play like something out of Phase 3 where things started getting ambitious and/or weird - with retro oddities like Thor: Ragnarok and visual marvels like Black Panther, give or take the odd CG rhino. Instead, this would be at home amongst the lame, contrived sequels of Phase Two. You know, back when people were excited about the idea of a Black Widow movie?I've also been told the character of Taskmaster constitutes another Mandarin scenario (\u00e0 la Iron Man 3, also from Phase Two) but I don't know enough about the original comics' character to judge.

I came in with low expectations given that this is a post-Endgame origin story for an original Avenger that feels overdue BUT I thought this was ultimately a very good film that tackled some of the most mature themes for a Marvel movie.We've waited a while to see Natasha's solo story and while they keep the Marvel fun and quips sprinkled in, her movie is more mature than other solo films and does quite a lot in its runtime. It tackles themes of regret, redemption, abuse and the exploitation of women to name a few. However, the choice was made to ultimately hang the film's hat on the theme of family and love. I surprisingly found myself in tears during multiple parts of the movie and I'm glad we're still getting Marvel films that hit us with relatable and empathetic stories.The supporting cast is great and the showcase of Florence Pugh for the future was wonderful. I actually think it takes a lot of humility for Scarlett to step somewhat aside to allow for the future to blossom in her overdue solo film and my hat is off to her for it.In terms of my criticisms, I agree that I wish I saw more of Taskmaster. I don't really care that it's a different version than the comics, I just wish the fight scenes were a bit more elaborative given that this enemy literally knows everyone's fighting style and should be thus more formidable.In terms of where this movie should have been placed in the MCU release timeline, I'm torn. If we had this released after Civil War, Natasha's sacrifice would've hit harder in Endgame BUT it would be a task to balance a Tony-centric and Natasha-centric ending. Having it now allows for each character to have more room to breathe as their stories close. Though I also agree it feels like this movie should've already happened.I don't know what the right answer is, but I'm glad that we have a Black Widow movie now, and I enjoyed what we got.

Leaving the MCU formula (which is what I was hoping for for phase four since it's no longer needed due to the popularity of the MCU,) good writing with lots of heart, good combination of shots and scores, and awesome action sequences, which is what I thought would be lacking considering the director's experience, glad I was proven wrong. Excellent performance all around.

Sure no crazy gadgets but the action was amazing.They did an amazing job using such short time to build up the backstory of Natasha and Yelena and then the beginning intro credits they started flashing through many scenes/images that all connected to how the upbringing/emotional/mentality of both Of them. It was very effective thats for sure.It gives u all these emotions as u watch the flashing scenes which brings u a sense of understanding of what they may have went through or experienced.The chemistry between Yelena and Natasha was actually pretty good. I enjoyed it very much as well as the Red Guardian too.Many funny moments and insane action packed crazy stunt work.I use to think a marvel comics movie has to have powers for the lead character or it will suck but this movie has made me consider differently. Some might say but Punisher had no powers but the action scenes werent as good even though it was just a tv show while this is a movie.Overall this movie has made me excited to watch Shang Chi thats coming out soon because if they can make this movie with lead character with no powers so successful then that movie surely will be amazing too.I really hope they bring back black widow in the future because Scarlet Johansson is the best!! Maybe they may try to bring white widow to replace ? But either way i hope they do!

My wife and daughter both liked it, who are not hardcore Marvel fans. Scarlett Johansson is a brilliant and talented actress, but honestly she sleepwalks through most of it.

Besides that it wasn't really needed. Red guardian was the other stand out character. All the performances are good, but the main flaw of this movie is the plot.

Her acting is tear-jerking and has great depth, which is not often seen in blockbuster movies. If you love 'Captain America and the winter soldier' then this film is for you. The post credit scene features a cameo that will remain unnamed to prevent spoilers, the addition of this (although expected) perfectly sets up a certain upcoming MCU project.

The plot is just decent, the villains are just alright and some jokes hit better than others, but the movie manages to be more than the sum of its parts; dark, often understated for a Marvel movie (though not the finale, for sure) and emotionally resonant in the moments where it tries. Think Winter Soldier but channelled through AMC's Killing Eve.The biggest plus by far is Florence Pugh, who manages to bring exactly the type of wild chaotic nonchallant energy to the movie that Jodie Cormer brings to Killing Eve's Villanelle.

This film is all about family and where Black Widow came from and honestly I love that aspect and what they were able to do with it all. The action is filmed in a way in which I really love and is a film that just keeps going and never has a slow moment.The Bad- I wish it came out after Civil War instead of Endgame. I also didn't like Taskmaster, he just felt like a throwaway character compared to how big of a character he is in the comics. In the final battle a lot of the special effects just looked chap or you can tell straight away that it is green screened. Now these are only small issues I had with the film and didn't take away from any enjoyment from the film.Overall Thoughts- Cate Shortland made an almost perfect Black Widow film with amazing performances, wonderful action I just wished it came out a couple of years earlier.

Go see it. Action out the yin yang, humor, family drama and it even has room for a rug pull or two. Marvel is back, baby!The Boring and Pretentious ReviewIt's been a while, huh? The 'rona put the brakes on Marvel's Phase 4 designs and it's taken more than a year to get back on track. Damn you, 'ronaaaaaaaaa! Was it worth the wait? Well that depends on your own perso-oh the hell with it, hell yeah it was worth the wait! Black Widow comes roaring into theaters this month to remind us what makes Marvel movies so damn fun and, boy, has it been about damn time.Ostensibly an origin story, this functions more as an expansion of Natasha Romanov, aka the Black Widow character history but the operating word here is action, action and dare I say it, even more action.Not quite a sequel, not a quite prequel (a midquel?) the film is set immediately after the events of Captain America: Civil War but follows more closely The Winter Soldier both in style and tone and could well serve as that film's spiritual successor. Like in Winter Soldier, director Cate Shortland and writers have opted for a cold war era style spy thriller. Don't worry if you haven't the director's name before, I hadn't either. After this she will become a household name joining the likes of Patty Jenkins from Wonder Woman giving the boys' a run for their money in directing comic book movies. And she ain't the only one. The ladies are running the show here with Florence Pugh and Rachel Weisz joining Johansson and a stellar cast that includes David Barbour (Hopper from Stranger Things) and Ray Winston, just in case you thought this was merely a filler film until the heavyweights arrive later in the year. This Widow is punching well above her weight class.Johansson always dominated her MCU scenes with Cap and the Avengers and here she is given chance to flesh out her character. But the entire cast displays a strong showing with Pugh, Weisz and Barbour in particular clearly enjoying themselves. They do such a great job it would be a shame if Marvel and The Mouse don't keep using these characters in the future.The film opens with a wholesome scene of Americana before cleverly setting up its spy thriller conceit that extends right into the opening credits. The action hijinks start early and they are frantic and non-stop with fight scenes that look choreographed by somebody that studied their Jason Borne well. Fights that feel desperate and immediate and make use of whatever household items happen to be around in order to subdue or kill an opponent. Violent gun fights, car chases, martial arts, it's all here.But besides all of that, Marvel's genius continues to be in the menacing villains it continues to come up with to antagonize the heroes. In The Taskmaster, they have another memorable one, a fighting power house that can imitate anybody's fighting style just by looking at them. The scenes featuring him are some of the best in the whole movie.To be fair, the film is not without its flaws. The plot gets a little convoluted at times and some of the action seem over-the-top compared to the tight groundedness of The Winter Soldier. And depending on your taste, its denouement will come across as trite but these are minor quibbles for a film that was such fun getting you there. A self-aware, action packed Marvel flick with maybe more than a hint of #metoo commentary, this injects a rejuvenating shot into a character that was by all means supposed to have been over and done with. Can't wait to see what else Marvel has in store.

Rachel Weisz (where have you been??? Please don't leave us again!) And David Harbour (who deserved a much better Hellboy movie) were both fantastic as well.And Marvel's decision to have a relatively unknown female director pays dividends from the start. The movie has a tender undercurrent of family, trauma and coming to terms with the choices you make that might easily have been missed by a more conventional action style director.And yes there is an end credits scenes at the very tail end. I laughed my butt off, and it is definitely leading ti something big down the road...Is it consequential to the MCU... maybe not?

(Spoiler even most of you already know it) so most of us have the sympathy of the character, second the movie obviously not focus on the main character (Natasha Romanoff) but I think they're focus on Yelena Belova which is Florence Pugh (Because the contract on Scarlett Johansson end in this film), and the last one I think there is too much CGI on this film that sometime makes me feel illogical to realize it out.

It has its flaws and it didn't meet my expectations. Mostly it works and it feels like something that Disney produced and that could be even a good or a bad thing.-The strongest positive of the movie it's the cast. I think the chemistry everyone had was excellent. It seemed that you've seen them interact before. By far Florence Pugh was the best one (I might have fallen in love with her). This is something that Disney does most of the time. Hire good actors that will have a good relationship with the fans in the future. Not only the chemistry, the acting was truly good. Better than in some other MCU movies.-Most of the characters are pretty good. I loved Yelena and Alexei. They were extremely funny and didn't feel forced. I'm truly hyped to see more of Yelena in the future. The rest of the characters were good. I would've liked to see more from Melina and even Natasha. I didn't feel closure for Natahsa's character and all she represented for the MCU in previous movies.-The action is excellent. There is no doubt that action scenes in Marvel have been improving with the years to a point that they became this epic and badass. The incredible action is thanks to beautiful visual effects. I didn't see many scenes where the CGI failed. It felt like a John Wick movie but with even more fantastic and unreal action which I love.-I loved the tone of the movie. A mystery and spy movie about Natasha escaping which connects with her past and a vengeance to be completed and allows us to meet new characters from her story. Characters that we'll see in the future and will be filling the hole that the ending of Scarlett's character left on a lot of fans. Something I liked was the way they connect it with movies like Civil War without feeling forced or the introduction of new characters without feeling like they could and should have appeared before.-I liked the comedy of the movie. I had an actual laugh at some parts of the movie. Let's say that only 15% of the jokes felt forced. Florence Pugh was G. O. A. T. I loved his character and his performance. She made me laugh a lot and without her this movie would easily be a 5 out of 10.-The post credit scene was the best part of the movie. It connects with other Disney shows and it opens a world of possibilities. I really want to see how it'll be handled and what direction will be taken.-I really liked Lorne Balfe's soundtrack. I loved him in M. I. Fallout and he killed it for Black Widow.Negatives\n-Black Widow is not even close to being perfect. It has a lot of flaws that are common in most MCU movies.-My biggest problem with the movie is the villain. Dreykov reminds me of the first MCU villains. Generic, boring, uninteresting, stupid and normal. I didn't like him at all and it's probably because it's a vengeance story which it's truly personal for Natasha's character but I just got to know this important part of her life. Plus the villain appears for no more than 15 minutes. Also Taskmaster was amazingly wasted. Why couldn't they go with the original story of Tony Masters and use him in the future to fight other heroes, because I don't see this character fighting Spiderman. This Taskmaster has no personality and lacks one of his best things which is his narcissism and his pride. He was pretty menacing until the \"big reveal\".-It was pretty predictable and the plot twists were meh. The only two I liked were the post credit scene and one more but the rest were unnecessary and too elaborated.-I keep thinking that this movie should've been made and presented before Infinity War. Knowing how the character's future ends makes you not worry about her and just focus on the rest.-A few plot holes that luckily weren't important.Conclusion\nI really liked Black Widow. I think it's a product that works and is successful in what they want, which is to introduce you to new characters that will participate in the future and will have a bigger role. The action was excellent and the style of the movie making it seem like a Jason Bourne movie was pretty good. The cast did a great job and I would love to see them again in the future. It fails in the villain aspect but at least that wasn't the focus. There is a villain because it's a superhero movie. And then there are the normal errors like some plot holes and how predictable it is. It's a movie that I recommend but I would say that if you are a true fan of Natasha you should watch it with low expectations because if not, you could dislike how the spotlight was focussed to the other characters. I would say that Black Widow is a John Wick movie with steroids."}, {"reviewer_name": "carkol2005", "date": "12 July 2021", "text": "And you know what? I expected it to be another thing, dunno why. Even when it's Marvel and it is always the same god-damned thing, with Natasha Romanoff I thought they could pull it off as a simple but effective action movie. Too bad nothing of that was given to me. What I got was a senseless plot, a pretentious dialogue wanting to belong to a family drama but failing and a CGI so bad it almost killed the movie by itself. For example, there's a scene a helicopter falls and crushes to the ground, as a pathetic attempt of making humor (hey, Marvel's trademark there). But how the hell do you pretend to be funny when the helicopter looks fake as hell and has CGI effects all over it? Come on, that was pitiful dude. When even the CGI is against you, you know you are in big trouble. Then, one of the main plot points of this movie are feromones. Yes, you heard right. And that plot point appears magically as a plot device in the moment to create some conflict, so it's completely stupid. The action sometimes is kinda interesting, I give the movie some credit for that, but the movie is way too long and way too talky, and in the end, for what? Just make a straightforward action movie Marvel, ok? Is that so hard?

Dreykov suffered from a lack of screen time but I felt like he was good in his scenes.

Trying to prove she's worthy of the title she shares with literal gods, it relies in unrestrained bombastic action, full things blowing up or crashing (using a not so good cgi), while the old good hand to hand combat one would come to expect from this movie is both brief and lacking.In the narrative department the movie gives you scenes full of emotional dialogue (along with jokes and exposition is the only type of dialogue I've found) with no build up to back it up. Why should anyone care about or even believe this \"family\" when they've only seen it for two minutes before cutting to a car chase.These wounds just deepen with a soundtrack who knows nothing of restraint, selling scenes with regular dialogue as pivotal moments or killing the tension in otherwise good action scenes that sound the same at the beginnig, when nothing has happened yet, and the end, when everything's going down.Wrapping up with the negatives, taksmaster is extremely underused (I don't really mind changes from it's comicbook counterpart), and the movie would benefit greatly from cutting the Morocco scene entirely (too many reasons to comment here). And don't get me started on the comments, jokes and references aimed specifically for the audience, for you to feel good because \"you got it\", taking you out of the story.To end in a positive note; Johansson, Harbour and Pugh give tremendous charisma to their characters.

I was pleasantly surprised to see that no moments like that existed and they just made a film about a Marvel Character and not a film about a woman Marvel Character.Scarlett Johansson yet again shows why she was made for this character and just outdoes herself, she literally makes me emotional! Florence Pugh is exceptional, again, as she is in everything she does. The pair of them together was just perfect chemistry. Then to top it off, it's literally a film about people who have no superpowers, they are just amazing fighters but their bravery matches any superhero!The two female movies we've had so far have been a woman who's a literal god and a woman who has powers that no one else can really compete with, now here we have a woman who has no powers but acts like she does, there was moments where I wanted to cry because I was finally witnessing the film I've always wanted to see.Absolutely smashed it out the park!

I can't say I had particularly high expectations, nor can I say I was particularly disappointed. At the end of the day it's still a Marvel movie, and even the worst of them are hugely enjoyable experiences. Thankfully Black Widow, despite its problems, doesn't hit too close to the likes of Iron Man 3. It's still a thoroughly entertaining movie full of thrilling action, hilarious comedy (especially if you like Marvel's style), enthralling characters, fantastic performances, and reasonably dark subtext. In some ways it feels like a Phase 2 movie, but in others you can tell they're starting to attempt new things. I'm not familiar with Cate Shortland, but it's clear to see where her input ended and the Marvel machine's second unit took over, and her slower moments were absolutely the film's strongest points. The over-reliance on CGI and superhuman physics meant that as entertaining as the action was, it was just more generic Marvel affair that had no real consideration for characters' power levels or fighting styles (Taskmaster is all about mirroring moves, and yet we don't see any of this actually on display, for instance). I give Black Widow a very conflicted 7/10, with a high chance of it falling as it gets rewatched."}, {"reviewer_name": "shivnarang", "date": "9 July 2021", "text": "Black Widow is finally out after several delays due to the global pandemic and is the first Marvel movie we've got in two long years. This is basically a fan service, so what you get is a filler movie, simply giving us some answers about Natasha's past.The story as we know from the trailer is about Natasha going back to Russia and is reunited with her dysfunctional family. The treatment of the movie is classic marvel, i.e. A little bit of emotional drama with comedy sprinkled over it enough to not let it go to the dark \"DC\" side. It has all the predictable yet fun elements in it.Scarlett Johansson reprises her role as Black Widow one last time and delivers another reliable kick-ass performance that we expect from her. We get all her signature moves- the kicks, the head locks and even the cool superhero landing. She is simply fantastic!Supporting her is her aforementioned dysfunctional family. The mom is smart, dangerous and cunning, played by the stunning Rachel Weisz. The dad is big and goofy but equally strong and menacing, played by the reliably charming David Harbour and finally the young kid sister is played by my Florence Pugh, who is equally bad-ass as her big sister Natasha and as annoying a young sibling should be. She is unarguably my favorite in the movie.This movie has everything you expect from a Marvel movie. The action set pieces are great and are choreographed to the highest entertainment level. The CGI is what we have come to expect from a Marvel movie. The cinematography and camerawork are also top notch.The two big negatives that I would say this movie has are -\na). It does not have a strong villain (it has two villains but neither of them are strong enough for our Avenger)\nb). We know exactly when and how Natasha is going to die in the MCU timeline, so at no point do we really feel that she is in any real danger during any of the fight scenes, so that takes away from a bit of thrill that it could've benefited from.Overall I would say Black Widow had a lot of potential to be great, but ends up being just good. Still, it's worth your time and money to go check it out in a theater near you, especially in an IMAX or Dolby, i.e. If you are fully vaccinated of course. Otherwise you can stream it on Disney+ Premier Access.P. S. - As is Marvel tradition, the movie has one post credit scene, so you'll probably have to tell your bladder to hush when the credits roll."}, {"reviewer_name": "ramisco", "date": "12 July 2021", "text": "I always loved the character abd was waitting for a long time for this movie, but it was a real dissaponitment.Missing a lot of the Black widoe history.

It is much more of a family story. All the actors and actresses in this movie are amazing. Especially Florence Pugh is giving a stellar performance. I really hope we get to see more of her character.I also liked that the pace of the movie was occasionally much slower than other Marvel movies. There are longer stretches where the acting and the story carry the movie. I became aware of this when I noticed that there was basically no CGI during these scenes. Thanks to the cast, these scenes were never boring or felt unnecessary.The humor is well-placed and entertaining without turning the movie into a comedy. Also, the 3D worked well and elevated several scenes.Note that (most of) the story takes place in 2016, after the events of \"Captain America: Civil War\". However, the movie completely stands on its own feet. There are, of course, some references to Captain America and the Avengers but you don't need to know these movies to understand or follow \"Black Widow\".9/10.

(Rated M)\nAs part of Marvels complete reversal of fortune (after nearly going bust years ago) \"Black Widow\" is the 24th film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe and it bodes well for their future success because no one left the advance screening I attended until the Easter Egg was laid and the cinema lights came on."}, {"reviewer_name": "Fireoil", "date": "7 July 2021", "text": "Again that dream team made me completely wrong, for a lot of people i think. You expect something. It gives you that path then suddenly it goes way more far. It was a tenacious but yet fragile movie to disappoint me in the story but the main memorable scene isn't action or typical mcu moment but a more intimate thing. They took exactly the opposite of what i would have done or expected of that movie. Instead of showing, it's characters centered. To not spoil but yet guide you. Remember the Famous scene of the youth of romanof when she get manipulated in Age of Ultron. Well this movie is more close to the dialogue between bruce banner and Romanoff instead. It makes you think instead of seeing things. It's the imagination used most of the time. Appart that beginning. Well it could have been that intro a movie but it's an amazing opening and it throws you quickly on the excitement of a new adventure but with very familiar vibe.If Spider man far from home officially close the phases we know. I think in terms of release date, this one is legitimately ends the MCU phases started in 2008.Few long moment and sometimes out of the move but overall a great MCU movie again and actors top notch, fight scene are mindblowing and the effect teams did a brilliant jobs."}, {"reviewer_name": "AzSumTuk", "date": "17 July 2021", "text": "Remember how Scarlett Johansson said her character wasn't treated like a piece of meat? Well, she must have talked about a different movie, because few comic book movies are as male-gazey as this one is. Even in \"Iron Man 2,\" where Tony Stark spoke about Natasha as if she was a toy he could buy, the way her body was shown by directors and cinematographers was much more respectable. Here, in \"Black Widow,\" most of Scarlett Johansson's scenes contain at least one prolonged, gratuitous shot centered on her backside or her breasts. Even the first shot with her in the first trailer is done this way. I really don't like this, and I honestly think it goes against any progressive ideas in the movie. If you wanted to make a movie about a bunch of women being freed from an oppressive tyrant, why would you objectify your leading actress so blatantly? Was Charlize Theron's Atomic Blonde treated like this? No, she wasn't. The makers of \"Black Widow\" have stolen plenty of ideas from \"Atomic Blonde\" (more on that - later). Why didn't they steal the idea that the leading lady can be treated like a great fighter and not like eye candy for teenage boys? I'm surprised that so few people have paid attention to this problem - and yes, it is a problem.Apart from this, the movie is just horrible. I'm sorry for saying it like this, but this is the truth. I stopped being an MCU fan a long time ago and the only reason I watched this movie was because the trailer promised more visceral action and a more personal story. It fails on both accounts.The action scenes are obviously heavily influenced by \"Atomic Blonde.\" \"Atomic Blonde\" happens to be one of my favorite recent action movies, so I'm happy that it influences much bigger movies, but the imitation just didn't work. First, Scarlett Johansson actually is not a good action performer. The use of a stunt double in this movie is way too obvious, whereas Charlize Theron did most of her stunts by herself - which made her character believable. Second, Natasha intentionally broke her own nose and then continued beating the snot out of the bad guy as if nothing had happened to her, whereas Lorraine Broughton felt every single punch she took, and that affected the way she fought. Lorraine bled, got tired, got dizzy... She was a human being, and Charlize Theron's perfection reflected that. Natasha Romanoff was like a robot who never felt pain, never got tired, never bled... I can't even blame Scarlett Johansson for this - that's how the character was written.Which leads me to the other huge problem - the writing. It has every problem you can think of. It's inconsistent. In the beginning David Harbour's Alexey (the only somewhat good performance in this thing, by the way) was shown as an incredible fighter - USSR's response to Captain America, a biologically modified super soldier who is strong enough to lift and throw a truck. Later he was shown snapping the Dutch Giant's arm like a twig just for the fun of it. After he was established like that you'd expect to see him maul bad guys in a fight scene, right? Well, that's not what you get. Instead, you see him take a beating in every single action scene after he escapes from prison. He has superhuman strength and extensive training in fighting, and yet he is constantly outperformed by people who are supposed to be normal, although well trained.Rachel Weisz's Melina is even worse. Weisz is an incredible actress, but even she couldn't save such a horribly written character. I'm sorry, but Melina tortures animals just to make a point. Literally. Who thought it would be a good idea to show a scene like this and then make her one of the good guys? And why did Natasha and Yelena treat her with much more respect than they treated Alexey with? Did the writers forget the story they'd written? You know, the story where Melina spent literal decades helping the main bad guy enslave women by her own free will, while Alexey was thrown in prison by the same bad guy? Do I actually need to explain why this bothers me?Natasha and Yelena take the cake, though - mostly because they're completely devoid of personality, and I'm sick and tired of MCU characters who don't have to live with the consequences of their actions. You know, either they conveniently die, or something cancels their actions out. In the middle of the movie we find out that Natasha has killed a child for nothing. An irredeemable sin, right? No. Plot twist - the child is alive and stronger than ever, she just needs to be saved by Natasha from her abusive father. Ugh. Just ugh. Everything is so convenient in this franchise.And. To top it all, this is yet another MCU movie that ends with an explosion in the sky. How many times are they going to make the same thing, before viewers finally get tired of it?All in all, this movie is a disappointment. It doesn't keep its promises. It treats its characters like pieces of meat. It's badly written. Even the action scenes can't save it.

It dispenses with the world saving high stakes of her Avengers ensemble films and has a much smaller scale, with a greater character focus which I loved. In style and tone this is more akin to The Winter Soldier, functioning as a more gritty spy movie than big superhero blockbuster.Her character arc and transformation from her previous appearances is explored more fully in this film, as we return to the oft alluded to dark past she thought she had left behind. We explore the inner workings of the Widows and all of this is done so well, feeling quite James Bondy at times. Getting this exploration of Natasha was long overdue and very welcome.The plot is good, with lots of emotional beats and solid action throughout. They really do just know how to tell stories on film over at Marvel Studios. The pacing is always spot on and Black Widow was no exception. The action was expertly crafted and the set pieces looked great up on the IMAX screen.The Marvel casting team very rarely miss, and aside from a slightly dodgy Russian accent from Ray Winstone, the cast were spot on. Florence Pugh is easily one of the best actresses working right now and her introduction to the MCU was triumphant. Everything about her character was perfect, from the emotion and backstory to the trademark Marvel humour, they nailed it all. David Harbour was equally brilliant and I do hope we get to see his Red Guardian again, I would be interested to see a Disney Plus show with him as our protagonist. Rachel Weisz I could have done with more of, but that's a small gripe. Scarlett was of course great in the role, she knows this character back to front by now and did her justice. The interactions between all 4 of these characters were so fun to watch.As with any great Marvel film, we also see some connections forming with other characters and MCU projects. Phase 4 is well and truly underway and I can't wait to see how everything comes together.Black Widow may not reach the heights of Marvel's best like Infinity War, but it has so much going for it and it is a most welcome addition to the MCU.

The trailer really got me and I thought that Marvel was attempting to make some kind of spy story. There is even a short quote to the classic 007 in the film, but it doesn't even come close to Fleming's work. I am always happy when a company decides to make a franchise flick about a secondary character, that may expand the narrative universe, but in this case nothing is really added to the MCU and this was a perfectly avoidable movie for several reasons:The narration is below expectations. Natasha's story is not really deepened, if not for a short intro that is clearly not enough to develop this character. There are way too many shootouts, fights and chases to the point where it becomes very chaotic and out of line. The few dialogues are, in most cases, ridiculous. Tons of situations that do not make any sense: Natasha and Yelena are human beings that received special training, not superheroes. Nevertheless they are completely immune to explosions or car accidents. They always get out with very few scratches, and they always win with no much effort. There is no tension, no real struggling moments for Romanoff's family. The plot twist during the last section of the movie is pretty much disappointing. As always there are also tons of forced comedy moments that nobody asked for.Considering the 200 millions dollars budget, the CGI is not good enough: fire and explosions animations are awful, the quality level of special effects in some sequences is comparable to the one of Matrix Reloaded, which was released in 2003. Seems like that there was no technology advancement in these last 20 years. Most of the scenes are over the top and completely unrealistic. I wonder who studied the physics and the dynamics for this movie, because the job done in this department is clearly very sloppy.\"Black Widow\" could have been a different movie, a spy story with intrigues and more practical stunt sequences, like \"John Wick\".

You'd think with people couped up indoors and limited diversions that they'd focus on the few things they're allowed to do, such as making movies. Yet even with all that time and focus, they still come up with mediocre movies like this.There are a few possible reasons as to why. One reason is Hollywood simply got lazy and took it's audience for granted, assuming because of the lockdowns, the audience would have little choice but to watch more movies. Another could be the depressingly lengthy lockdowns caused many filmmakers to be less inspired to create anything new and exciting. And finally, perhaps the current politically correct environment forced producers to hire filmmakers not based on merit but on superficial attributes in a superficial attempt to conform. But most likely it's some combination of the above.Anyway, about the film. Right off the bat, the movie had a tough task to make an uninteresting character interesting. But Marvel is no stranger to this. Two of the best films in their franchise were about previously little known superheroes, Iron Man and Thor. If they could work their magic on this film, perhaps they could capture our interest in the Black Widow, as they did about a guy and his special suit or a guy and his magical hammer.Unfortunately, Marvel's magic ended with Captain America. Black Widow stumbled out of the gate with an incredibly silly action sequence in which Natasha and her family escape trouble by taking off in their plane with her father hanging on one of the wings. Then it was all downhill from there. Poor character development, lack of chemistry and a familiar plot pretty much did this film in. Let's put it this way. If Black Widow had been released first instead of Iron Man, no way the other Marvel films would've been made."}, {"reviewer_name": "samr-13848", "date": "11 July 2021", "text": "Really good movie with funny characters(red guardian and Yellina) with good action scenes and a mediocre villain."}, {"reviewer_name": "anabunib", "date": "10 July 2021", "text": "What a grounded approach to a superhero movie after so much of alien invasions!

Black Widow has everything a classic Marvel fan would enjoy, yet is easily understood by viewers with no prior knowledge of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Behind all the superhero cowls is fantastic character development. Each character experiences a different emotional journey, finding themself in an extremely different emotional place compared to the beginning of the film.Black Widow serves as a prequel to Avengers: Infinity War, shining light on plot lines we had no clue occurred. The film picks up right after the events of Captain America: Civil War where Natasha Romanoff (Scarlett Johansson) is on the run from the U. S. government. When Natasha is attacked by the iconic villain Taskmaster (Olga Kurylenko), she is led to confront her past. When she learns the Red Room is still functioning (kidnapping and training widows), she must team up with unlikely allies to defeat the organization once and for all.For comic book junkies there is always a worry that superhero movies will sometimes be a bore, because you already know the story so well. Black Widow abolishes this worry with multiple twists and turns that are new to comic book fans, yet are very respectful to classic superhero origins. When people think of the character Black Widow, they extremely undermine the grittiness of her backstory. Director Cate Shortland is marvelous at mixing in Natasha's dark past to boost her character development and show what drives her day today.Black Widow is one of the darkest Marvel movies to date. Throughout the film, rough and sensitive topics present themselves such as child trafficking, drug use and suicide. The film also includes multiple curse words and many different instances of intense action. Despite the gloomy tone, the film explores themes of family and reminiscence. Morals are taught to younger viewers demonstrating the message that people can change; you just need to give them a chance.I give Black Widow 5 out of 5 stars and recommend it for ages 13 to 18, plus adults. You can stream Black Widow on Disney+ with premiere access or watch it in your local theater on July 9, 2021. Make sure to check it out!Reviewed by Jude A., KIDS FIRST!"}, {"reviewer_name": "MogwaiMovieReviews", "date": "9 July 2021", "text": "The good news is, for the first hour and a half, Black Widow is actually a little better than the abomination I'd expected: there's some competently-handled-if-distractingly-implausible action scenes, the CGI is decent enough, and the 'girl power' nonsense is mostly kept to bearable levels until the VERY tiresome last half hour.But in a film with an overwhelmingly female cast, every single one of them is presented as either a smart and competent hero or a victim: there are no female villains, only big bad (white) men, every single one of whom is either arrogant and evil or stupid and useless. The single exception to this rule, the rather obvious diversity hire playing Mason, O-T Fagbenle, is easily the worst performance in the film, and Ray Winstone (terrible accent), William Hurt and even the Taskmaster character are wasted and disastrously underused, offering no real threat and hardly being onscreen at all.Johansson and Florence Pugh are both solid, but they have very little of any substance to work with. There's no weight to any of the emotional scenes and just about all the jokes fall flat. Rachel Weisz and David Harbour as the parents are OK but their characters' changing behaviours (and ability to construct sentences in English) make no sense. The big change made to the Taskmaster was a disappointment as well and detracted from the character.In the final analysis, it's not the very worst superhero film ever - and certainly not as bad as Captain Marvel or WandaVision - but the last half hour falls apart VERY badly, and the rest of it is a long, dull and largely underwhelming slog, with nothing you haven't seen many times before in better movies, just done quite a bit worse, and in this it bodes badly for the future of Marvel."}, {"reviewer_name": "Tactrix", "date": "9 July 2021", "text": "So with this movie they did a couple things very poorly.

And I understand they wanted to give it this atmosphere of helplessness, but what happened instead is it translated as a miserable time the entire movie.The other thing that really bothered me is they had this kind of broken humor where it never quite hit the mark, and again I think they were going for a family that wasn't a real family thing, but it just came off as bland and fell flat.Having said that, there was something very real about the way they presented the lives of spies where they would just have to pack up and leave in an instant. And an authenticity to the fact that afterward their entire family kind of fell apart without a sense of home.I don't think this went far enough into the avengers side of the movie and too far into a past that didn't really play correctly in this particular universe.8/10 great acting, great directing, the plot was just very hit and miss for me."}, {"reviewer_name": "lahiruyasas-54439", "date": "9 July 2021", "text": "Never thought this movie would be this boring.

It felt like some random loyal-free music could have done a better job than that. The Score is so unmemorable that it is hard to recall it even after 5 mins of ending the movie. There were annoying sonic boom SFX whenever a name of a city was shown or even if someone outright stepped out of a car, it felt annoying. And some of the songs are not even suitable for the movie, During the opening scenes when Natasha and Yelena were forcibly taken to the red-room a very generic and random slow song was played, it was not only annoying but took the essence of the dark, gritty scene away from me. Also, it had cheap thrills by Sia in it.Plot:\nThis movie is almost a rehash of Captain America Winter Soldier. Both the movies had their main character on the run and their mission was to end some international secret espionage organization. The Main Character has a partner to help him/her in the mission (Yelena in Black Widow, Black Widow in Winter Soldier). But that is not enough, they will need more people to help extract info about the organization (Red Guardian and Melina in this case; Falcon in Winter Soldier). Both the villains are mere humans with a brainwashed assassins who share a history with the main character (Taskmaster in Black Widow; Bucky in Winter Soldier). Both the final battle take place in an aircraft which comes crashing down as a consequence of the fight. Too much resemblance. There were many stupid moments in the movie as well like when Natasha was sent the red anti-dot by Yelena and when Yelena meets Natasha in Budapest they have a fight scene, why? Both of them know that both why they were there right then why did they have to fight? Also, it is very convenient the it was the protagonist's \"fake\" parents who were closely tied to the Red Room. The jokes in the movie are not funny and feel very forced. Another stupid thing I noticed is the slow walking of the Task Master, if that guy knew how to run then this movie would have ended in the first 20 mins but Plot convenience saves the day. Black Widow as per known is a mere human with good fighting abilities yet she got out of some really questionable scenes, one scene she fell from 5 stories crashing into metal pipes without any much of damage? How!? There were many occasions when cars in which Black Widow was seated in exploded or overturned and fell on its head yet she survives?! No explanation for that. The plot was predictable to a major extent within the first 30 mins. Another Stupid scene I remembered was when Both Natasha and Yelena revealed much of the secret information in a public store! Sure, it didn't have any effect on the movie itself but it was stupid of spies to do that in public, and this was followed by another awkward and forced joke. The tone of this movie very inconsistent in my opinion, one moment it is some dark gritty movie with murder and kidnapping and next moment we have Red Guardian talking about his fishing days.Characters/Acting:The movie had a stellar cast yet it failed to deliver much of it. Scarlett Johansson nodded a lot and that I can remember, she has been doing this for 10 years so she was just like how she was supposed to be. Florence Pugh was undeniable the best amongst the ones we got. She was well written and her acting was convincing. The Villain appeared for 2 mins in the beginning and then straight had probably a 15 min appearance towards the end and died an underwhelming death. Not well written at all. Taskmaster was wasted. Taskmaster is an intimidating character in the comics but in the movie, they basically made him a mouth-shut assassin who walks really slowly when the opposite is needed. Red Guardian was wasted as well. He was used as a comic relief character but the jokes were LAME. Melina was well underwhelming. None but Yelena's character was at least decent.Other issues:The forgettable dialogue and fight scenes. Marvel realized how lackluster this movie actually is so the definite choice was to include some unwanted fight scenes. Jail Break and Yelena Natasha fight scene are prime examples. (Also, when Yelena and Natasha were having the fight in a residential apartment, did you know bother to hear or wonder what the hell was going on in the neighbor's room). Even the VFX in some scenes were awful which is surprising coming from a Marvel Movie.Redeeming qualities:Florence Pugh's performance has to be a redeeming quality of the movie. Despite all the issues, this movie did keep me invested in it. Lot of people are complaining that this is a boring movie but I disagree with that. Other than that, I didn't find any other redeeming qualities.There are better spy or superhero movies as a matter of fact that do better do than this but if you are Marvel Buff then sure see this one but chances are you will be disappointed as well4/10."}, {"reviewer_name": "michelelewis88", "date": "18 July 2021", "text": "I'm sorry to hear sol these bad reviews.

The opening sequences are great as we meet the different cast members and have their roles defined, but that felt like the entirety of the movie. While it's understood that the majority of this film is a recollection of Black Widow's past, a large chunk of this movie felt like \"Black Widow is on her way to meet \"x\" character... Again\". This lead to the plot feeling very predictable and hackneyed, even for Marvel's standard. You know what you'll get when you go to a super hero film, but even this was dull. The lack of action and amount of rehashing scenes made for very slow pacing.Another issue I had with Black Widow was the lack of a compelling villain, even with one of the coolest Marvel villains being in the film. Let's make this very clear: from the standpoint of a comic book nerd or casual watcher, this is NOT the Taskmaster you want to see. Instead, Taskmaster is used as a pawn to serve a one dimensional villain that has been done thousands of times. The height of action in the film barely involves Taskmaster, which is just disappointing. Instead, we get a small scuffle with Red Guardian and an apology from Black Widow. Yes, Marvel, this is exactly what people want to see from (what's supposed to be) the most badass character in the film.The conclusion to the film is incredibly lazy, too. Classic misdirection by the director to make it seem like Black Widow will be turned in by her mother, only for that to be the plan all along. Any hole in the story moving forward is then met with a flashback to a conversation you never saw in the first place. What makes it so awful, though, is that it's all predictable.

The comedy and emotional points were pinned perfectly at the best times. The theme of family was a unique and emotional choice that I enjoyed. Also I have to add the \"Smells like Teen Spirit\" Cover is amazing. However as a big Taskmaster enthusiast, I was pretty disappointed with what they did to her. In the comics, Tony Masters has a lot of character, one they didn't go into in this movie. I would have liked to see more character development in Taskmaster. Besides that, I thought it was a good movie and in my opinion was worth waiting for."}, {"reviewer_name": "seizethehappiness74", "date": "11 July 2021", "text": "Black Widow is an important character in the Marvel universe, and then this movie pops out and you see how a bad production can be done in every way.

My biggest issue with this movie was the pacing of the movie. To me, there never really was a moment where the movie never really picked up for me and it just felt really slow. I know this movie wasn't meant to be fully action-packed but the family dynamic just didn't work for me at all. When the movie ended I legit just thought wow nothing really happened in this and was disappointed by it. On the topic of the family dynamic, I will say it definitely wasn't because of the acting since you can see all four of them really trying their best in this movie. Florence Pugh, who plays Yelena Belova, for me personally was the real stand out of the actors in this movie. Whenever you see the \"family\" on screen together you can easily see and tell how everybody feels about this. Marvel has not been known to have the best villains but in recent movies, we've been getting some better villains but, \"Black Widow\" just brought back the terrible villain. The villain in this movie is just so boring and lacks motivation. It also doesn't help that the audience never sees them. I feel like the biggest reason why this movie just didn't work for me is because of the story. The story didn't feel like it flowed very well from beginning to end and needed some tweaking. In the end, Black Widow just isn't a memorable movie and I will easily forget about it."}, {"reviewer_name": "kafuireigns", "date": "10 July 2021", "text": "Expected way too much for this movie and I got it thrown right in my face proving me wrong\nWon't hesitate to watch it again."}, {"reviewer_name": "mariewupper-81436", "date": "10 July 2021", "text": "Really don't understand the bad reviews, I enjoyed this film very much.

The movie is okay. The 134-minute runtime didn't drag like I thought it would, but it wasn't particularly good either. The comedic moments are fine, and the action is fast. However, the action does nothing new, and it can be a bit bland. The villain of the movie is also pretty lame.As an exploration of Natasha's character, it's ok, despite being years too late (spoiler alert: don't get too attached to her...). I guess it tells the story of her troubled past well, but it doesn't really add anything interesting to her personality. I don't feel any more of a connection to her character now than I did before watching. It essentially feels like the purpose of the movie is to bring Florence Pugh's character into the MCU, rather than coming from a genuine desire to tell Natasha's story. The multi-billion dollar MCU pushing industrialized, uninspired media out? It's crazy to think about, I know.As far as the acting goes, everyone was fine, although I thought the Russian accents were kind of awful.

The premise of the film sees after the events of Captain America: Civil War, Natasha Romanoff is on the run and forced to reunite with figures from her past to uncover a mystery.Main Character\nScarlett Johansson is back for potentially her final time as Black Widow and she is really good in the main role here. We have always seen her as a supporting player but she is thrust into the main character and thrives. Her really interesting backstory is further explored and it allows us as an audience to get more time with her and really see and learn more about her. She is also great in the action sequences and has great chemistry with the rest of the cast as well.Supporting Characters\nFlorence Pugh plays Yelena and for me she was the best part of the film. The chemistry between her and Johansson is fantastic and was the emotional crux of the film, she is great in the action scenes and nails the humorous and emotional scenes that are required. Dave Harbour and Rachel Weisz play there bizarre parents and they are both great, Harbour is sometimes seen as comic relief and does it well but also has some good emotional moments for him to deliver. Weisz is more stoic and intense but plays an important role and you see how these four are so dysfunctional but really need each other. As seen in the trailer Taskmaster is the villain here and I think diehard fans of the character will be disappointed but I thought it worked for this film. He reminded me of the T1000 from Terminator 2 and was just a warrior hunting Black Widow but there is very little character there to bet invested in. That links to the greater issue that is Ray Winstone as the villain and that whole part of the film, it is really generic and he isn't given anything interesting to work with and his motivations and whole arc is kind of in the background and it just didn't work for me.Story\nThe story is decent, this is basically a film about the concept of family and how it isn't always the people you choose and that part of the film was good for sure with all the actors really selling it and I grew to care about all of them and the relationships that get built up. But again my main criticism was the whole villain angle of the film, Taskmaster isn't as interesting as he could have been and the whole generic Russian bad guy is surely played out but used here and I also had an issue with the actual ending of the film. It is really abrupt and doesn't really make sense when linked up to its place in the timeline.Script\nI thought the script was good, I have seen some criticism of the amount of humour involved but I actually though this film took itself quite seriously for the first act. The model for the MCU is to try and balance the humour and drama and I thought the film did it well, I felt the drama when it wanted and I laughed when it wanted so I give the film credit for that.Style\nThe film has some huge action set pieces but I thought they all worked really well, obviously there is a difficulty to raise tension and stakes with a prequel but the film did as good as possible with those limitations. The film is paced well, and felt an appropriate length, though maybe 5 more minutes at the end would have been appreciated.Overall\nOverall, Black Widow is a great fun film that is worth the year long wait for big Marvel fans. If you are on board with The MCU then go and see Black Widow as you will enjoy it and there is a big post credit scene here too."}, {"reviewer_name": "mhorg2018", "date": "9 July 2021", "text": "This was really a disappointment.

Yes, Captain Marvel was technically a prequel, but it was a prequel before the main events of the MCU unfolded. Black Widow takes place in between Captain America: Civil War and Avengers: Infinity War. Therefore, the movie does link in with what the audience already knows about what is going in the universe at this time. This movie doesn't spend too much time explaining that for this reason.The director and producers have said that they tried a new action filming style in this movie, and it shows. I don't know if I like it or hate it because I don't know if I would have noticed if I didn't know it was in the movie.As per most MCU movies, they try to lighten the mood of an otherwise very series movie with some sarcasm and jokes. I would say most of them hit home and connect with the audience with some of them seeming oddly timed and just plain flat. I don't think I would penalize them for that, especially since (in my opinion) the jokes that were used in the movie were never really offensive or politically driven. Which is still nice to see a movie where it isn't politically driven. Some may disagree with me on this given the antagonist of the film is a middle aged white man. I would disagree with you on this premise: we have known about this villain since the first Avengers movie. Since we already know about him I don't see this as a politically driven movie, especially since the villain is already mentioned in Natasha's backstory before we just haven't seen him on screen.Overall I think Dreykov was the right choice for a villain in this movie. Some may say they wish this plot was about Natasha and Clint's mission in Budapest, in which technically this movie actually does revolve around that mission. That Budapest mission is part of why this movie is so important to Natasha in the first place. We find out in this movie that Budapest was the final mission in Romanoff's defection to SHIELD back in the day by supposedly killing Dreykov and his daughter. We find out that was not what happened that day and the team goes about trying to find Dreykov and killing him.Also some may say that it seems Natasha was a sidekick in her own title movie. With that I mostly disagree since it does seem that a good amount of the focus of the movie is on Natasha. Now it is most obvious 5 minutes in that this will be more of a sister movie then a solo film given that most of the plot revolves around the sister relationship between Natasha and Yelena. In which I think this movie handles that plot point very well and allows both characters to build screen time and fill us in little by little on their backstory.I don't know if this film will stand the test of time when it comes to story quality. The story writers behind the film come from the MCU Disney+ entry side of things and it does show in some parts of the story. You can tell the writers have done more episodic entries before and not as many movies since some scenes in Black Widow feel cut and dry.We also seem to be in an age in the MCU right now where we are rebuilding some of our core heroes and this film helps to do that. Every Disney+ entry in the MCU right now either gives a true backstory to a hero or introduces a hero to a new role and this film does that as well. It sets up Yelena to eventually take on the Black Widow mantle on the Avengers or Secret Avengers one day.I did like this movie as a whole and while it was quite fun to see Natasha in a movie that didn't include other big characters in the MCU, it was also cool to see a new side of her as a sister to Yelena. I also quite liked how Yelena was introduced. She seems to be a light hearted version of Natasha and I think it works. Time will tell on that one.I hope you enjoyed the first MCU movie since 2019, I sure did and it was still a fun movie even if it has a few holes."}, {"reviewer_name": "onemckinney", "date": "19 July 2021", "text": "The movie has a great female cast.

Both this and FATWS seem to have the same issue of the grandeur of the movie being very small in comparison to the rest of the MCU.The opening is very awkward with Nat have blue hair for some reason back in 1995, the family all together that have to head on the run from the US police and Alexi being able to hang onto a plane but then again he is the Red Guardian. Leading into the credits this has the feel of the Bourne Identity same style of credits and the change up to The smells like the only song from Nirvana that fans know.Then jump to just after Civil war and truly i think this should have been released then! The whole story revolves around Nat on the run from General Ross for breaking the Sikovia Accords plus this new gas that breaks the mind control of the Widows from the Red room. Ross honestly didint need to be in this movie, thought this would have been the start of the Thunderbolts and the only details pointing towards that is that Ross is ill and may be searching for a cure........ becoming the Red Hulk? The rest of the first act is the reunion with Yelena and then the break out of the Red Guardian. Have to say these are the stand out of the movies, David Harbour and Florence Pugh are the redeeming factor of this film. The Dynamic is that teenage daughter that doesnt want to listen to Dad jokes but ends up laughing at all of them! The fight scenes are well choreographed but from the start the CGI doesnt match the grandeur of the scene. They obviously had a budget and that was the best they could do with it. All other series and movies seem to be on another level, even the older Thors and Iron Mans. Not sure if they've changed teams or if this was done on home desktops at home but just didint seem right.The second act again isnt really anything special just them getting to see Melina. Bit of Exposition on what the Tape they stole in the opening and is a lot of mind control breakdowns to control the Widows. They get captured and taken to the Red Room, which somehow is a giant Russian Helicarrier in the sky. A dig at the Russians from the america producers their engines are coughing out smoke compared the american made Stark Tech with the clean blue burning of repulsor engines.The ending this just doesnt excite me, their captured they fight their way out, small hiccup in the plan, over come that, free the other widows with the new gas that was found and then kill General Dreykov. Hes just a boring general with a bad accent very much the same as Danny Huston in Wonder Woman. Just Ray Winstone's accent is far worse!The most disappointing thing about this whole film is Taskmaster turns out to be the daughter of Dreykov, doesnt speak and has a chip that allows her to track and remember movements of people shes fought! This is such an exciting character from the comics and even the Spiderman game on PS5 just made the character a kitted out bodyguard!Overall its a shame this is Scarlett Johansson's last visit to the character, just doesnt hit home as well as her death in Endgame. Standouts for sure are Florence Pugh and David Harbour i hope these are returning soon to the MCU!The post credit works well after a characters introduction in FATWS. As if this was the first moment of them being introduced this would be a total disappointment when thinking the ThunderBolts were coming to the MCU. But totally confirms that Yelena is returning and hunting a bowcasting hero for a certain series!"}, {"reviewer_name": "LRuhl", "date": "14 July 2021", "text": "You're most definitely not alone if you've been waiting patiently for the release of Marvel's Black Widow, after over a year of delays thanks to a certain world-wide pandemic, your patience has finally paid off. Originally slated to release May 1st of 2020, Disney pushed it's most recent Marvel release multiple times, eventually settling for a July 9, 2021 release. Well, with that day finally here, and a $215 million world-wide opening weekend, it's easy to say that everyone who either flocked back to the theaters, or caught the film through premier access on Disney+, was eager to see the official launch of phase four's feature films.Black Widow tells the story of Natasha Romanoff(Scarlett Johannson) directly following the events of Captain America: Civil War, where she turns on her fellow Avengers to aid in the escape of Steve Rogers' Captain America and Bucky's Winter Soldier, thus violating the Sakovia Accords. The film however opens up in a small 1980's Ohio town where we see Natasha living with a seemingly normal family. She has a Mother, a Father, and a sister, but it is quickly revealed that this normal family isn't a family at all, rather one of many global Russian sleeper cells just playing the part. Forced to flee the country and separate, queue opening credits montage, Natasha and her sister Yelena are taken back to their homeland with several other girls to begin their training for the Black Widow program in the ominous Red Room run by Soviet General Dreykov.Jump ahead 21 years we find Natasha on the run from the U. S. Government, and Yelena, a Black Widow, on a mission with her fellow widows. Yelena, after acquiring her target, is hit with a mysterious red gas that presumably breaks whatever mind control or brainwashing she seemed to be under. Later we find out that these vials of red gas are antidotes to the mind control tactics used to train Black Widows in the Red Room. These vials contrast the vials of Super Soldier serum we see in Falcon and the Winter Soldier. Enter Taskmaster, Dreykov's elite assassin trying to kill Natasha, who receives a package from Yelena that turns out to be the antidote. She is prompted to return to Budapest after her escape from Taskmaster.Yes, we finally get some context on what happened in Budapest all those years ago with Hawkeye, and don't forget, it's Budape(sh)t. Once there she is forcefully greeted by Yelena, in a former safe house where Hawkeye aided in Natasha's defection to S. H. I. E. L. D. years ago. Holes in the wall made by arrows were appropriately referenced.We then jump to a secluded Siberian prison where an aged Red Guardian, their former fake father and now serving a life sentence, is easily defeating every prisoner in a game of arm wrestling before being interrupted with some special mail that includes an earpiece connected to Natasha and Yelena ready to break him out of prison. Action and mayhem ensue.With a narrow escape, the three set off to locate their former \"mother\" Melina, one of Dreykov's top scientists researching the effectiveness of his mind control tactics. The family theme eventually takes center stage as the four are back together again for the first time since Ohio. Natasha seems to be the only one that's bitter about the thought of them as a family, and rightfully so with the film revealing that she was in fact taken away from her biological mother instead of being picked up trash from the street, but Yelena argued that it was \"real\" for her.The end begins at the Red Room, hidden in the clouds, with an action packed sequence reminiscent of the aerial battle at the end of Captain America: Winter Soldier. The four working together to take down Dreykov and free the current Black Widows. Also, by this point in the movie you may have taken notice of the amount of the color Red in this film. The Red Room, the red antidote, Dreykov's red screen. When discussing themes and symbols in film, red is used to signify blood, hate, murder and anger, but considering the russian influence, it's also juxtaposed with the influence of the color red from Russian history.Family and loneliness are common themes that are included in so many books, tv shows, movies, etc., but the subtle approach to such broad themes in this film are refreshing. It doesn't feel like the overbearing, ride-or-die with my family feeling that you would get from a Fast & Furious movie, but rather more explores the \"we hate each other but have to make the best of it\" side of family. Natasha has always known that these people are not her real family and has revealed that her abandonment is something she thinks about on a daily basis. She has always been alone, until her days with S. H. I. E. L. D. and the Avengers, and even then she still felt like an outcast because she was the hero with a terrible past. After the events of Civil War her family is taken away from her again, which would likely explain why she was so hesitant to join the side of Steve Rogers in the first place because of that fear of losing family and having to live a lonely life on the run once again.I know we are all well aware of the absolute absurd amount of fan theories that plague the internet these days when it comes to everything Marvel, especially the MCU, and we should all know by now that these theories are indeed fun, but frequently are mostly wrong. They usually include guesses on who the next villain will be, which hero will be introduced next, or which comic will be adapted to the MCU. If you were expecting one of these theories to come to pass, you may be disappointed. I found this film to be an odd choice for introducing the fourth phase of MCU films. It still very much felt like an Infinity Saga film, with some James Bond qualities, even though it seemed to hold up on it's own as well.The actors outside of Scarlett Johannson were all quality picks. David Harbour plays an aged Red Guardian to the T, offering some comedic relief to his character. Rachel Weisz plays Melina, perfectly capturing the evil no nonsense side of her character. And Florence Pugh plays Yelena, who I must say could easily take over the Black Widow role in future Marvel projects.I know this film has had a lot of time to build up expectations, but don't expect this film to blow you away. It was nice to get answers to questions we've had for many years and it felt like it was a necessary send-off for an actress and one of the original Avengers who has been blessing us with her talents for so many years, but in the end, it felt like an older movie that was made to fill in some blanks."}, {"reviewer_name": "harry_tk_yung", "date": "14 July 2021", "text": "It has been a long wait, after the conclusion of the decade of the Marvel Universe under the Avengers (heart-breaking and heart-warming, both) in the spring of 2019. The pandemic wrecked all time tables. DC stole a move in the beginning of this year, with \"Wonder Woman 1984\". Finally, after a 2-year wait, we get to see Natasha Romanoff, the Black Widow that became an Avenger, and died as one, on a lonely distant planet. What we see here are therefore back stories filling somewhat the blank that has been tantalizing us for an entire decade.The movie starts with on-screen text \"Ohio 1995\". The very ordinary-looking American family of 4 brings to mind right away the popular TV series \"The Americans\", except that the two kids here are both girls, rather than a boy and a girl. But this difference is superficial. The most significant difference is that while both families are Russians undercover in the U. S., the Americans has a real family, at least biologically. In \"Black Widow\" the family is devoid of any biological connection, that is, four individuals assembled randomly, if not haphazardly. Mother Melina (Rachel Weisz) is \"the brain\", father Alexei (David Harbour) is \"the muscle\", while the two daughters Natasha (Violet McGraw) and Yelena (Ryan Kiera Armstrong), early-teen and pre-teens respectively, are material for chemically enhanced super-soldiers (\"widows\") similar to the Winter Soldier.A perfectly normal evening is disturbed by some secret signal received suddenly, and the next thing we see is the family driving away from town heading towards their predetermined destiny. A period pop piece \"American Pie\" plays on the radio, to the family's delight, and you have a feeling that you'll hear it again before it's all over.An outburst of action ensues, car chase, gun shots, exhilarating flight, winding up in an airfield Cuba. The family is going to be separated, despite ferocious protestations from Natasha. \"My girls are strongest\", comes the parting words of Alexei as Melina is apparently dying from a gunshot wound.Fast forward to a familiar scene (to Avenger fans), the King of Wakanda just killed by an explosion, in Vienna. Natasha, a.k.a. Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) is leaving the chaotic scene and becomes a fugitive. Meanwhile, in Morocco, Yelena (Florence Pugh) is also a fugitive, hunted by the \"widows\" (as in deadly spiders) she has turned against.Upon the reunion of the sisters (a highly entertaining melee action sequence), now grown-up, bits and piece of background fall into place as the main plotline is revealed. The sisters have turned against the \"Red Room\" where they were trained to be effective killing machines. Now, their self-assigned mission is to hunt down its leader Dreykov (Ray Winstone) to avenge their mother's death. But then, you know full well that someone with the caliber of Rachel Weisz would not be cast to appear for only 10 minutes at the beginning of the movie.While there are undercurrents of serious matters (mind control, issues with immigrant, women's role), the main draw of this movie, to me, is the fun of the quasi-family interaction, particularly the siblings. Racing to get away from pursuits, Natasha yells to Yenela \"seat belt!\" and gets a crisp retort \"such a mom\". And then, Yelena loves to tease her older sister about \"the pose\", with which we are so familiar in the Avenger movies, Black Widow landing from a jump, steadily crouched with one leg fully stretched out and the other bent, one arm in front with fingers firmly planted on the ground, and the other holding a weapon or in clenched fist. But of course, this was not invented by Black Widow. The two classic icons with \"the pose\" are Trinity (Carrie-Ann Moss, in \"The Matrix\") and Selene (Kate Beckinsale, in \"Underworld\"), both alluringly clad in black.To pull off such \"fun\" we have a great support cast that, alas (to some), is unquestionably guilty of show-stealing. Weisz is quite contained as the brilliant but meek scientist, with a just few jabs of sarcasm. Harbour, well-loved in the amazing series \"Stranger Things\", goes all out in portraying the \"Red Guardian\", annoying and endearing, in equal measures, to his two \"daughters\". Most guilty is Pugh. Coming off an Oscar-nominated performance in \"Little women\" (2019), she brings to us a Yelena with layers in depth, a deadly killing machine, world-wearied (despite being so young), residual tremor from the Red Room training and yet, beneath all these, we can still see the vulnerable little girl (beautifully played by Ryan Kiera Armstrong) who looked up to, and dearly loved, her sister.While Pugh is consistently good throughout the movie one shot is pure gold. During the time when the two sisters go separately to carry out different tasks, Yelena makes a half-baked attempt, jumping down from a height and landing with \"the pose\", awkwardly. \"Disgusting\", she murmurs to herself. I'd give Pugh an Oscar just for that shot.The brief post-credit scene pretty well marks Pugh for a larger role in the new M. C. U. Universe that is being shaped, as we speak."}, {"reviewer_name": "emrexdzgn", "date": "12 July 2021", "text": "This is just a regular action movie nothing more.

Scar Jo does okay for her role but I expected to see a new dimension in her character and it never happened & she often got overshadowed by Florence Pugh's Eleyna who was just amazing & I am looking forward to her future in MCU. David Harbor's character is just a bumbling idiot & Rachel Weisz offers nothing. The Villains are once again very boring. Some of the Action sequences are good.

It's perhaps one of the more serious and dialogue-heavy entries of the Marvel Cinematic Universe but Scarlett Johansson, Florence Pugh, David Harbour and Rachel Weisz bear a convincing enough dynamic and carry a straightforward spy narrative with decent emotional depth. Per the Marvel norm, the action delivers plentiful fast-paced thrills and the film isn't short of comedic relief, often poking fun at old Marvel character tropes and allowing David Harbor to get absolutely lost in his role; he's rather delightful and I hope to see more of him in later media.The villains are pretty forgettable, though, and I felt the relationship between the four main characters was a tad lacking. The first 15 minutes set an interesting and almost artful standard that hooked me immediately but it pretty much goes the formulaic comic book movie route after that point and it's...good; I got to fully understand Natasha and receive some closure on her story, though I can't help but note the missed opportunities. I think more flashbacks like the prologue would've helped cement an even stronger chemistry amongst the leads. We mostly just get a general idea of how they're associated and then it's your typical Marvel fare but it's the performances overall that kept me invested.

Who really is she? How did she become Black Widow? The film answered all of that. But, honestly, I expected more. I felt like her story was this typical story of a woman who becomes a spy/agent. Which in my opinion makes the impact on the character weak and little. The plot is just so predictable and there's nothing new about it at all. You would know where it's going and what'll happen. Also, the dialogues were cheesy and gringy at sometimesThe villain in the film was barely even there. For Taskmaster, all i'm saying is that they really ruined the character.

And ontop of the huge plot holes in the movie, I also for the love of me can't figure out how on earth a movie with a 200million dollar budget, has such bad CGI. The CGI in this movie is seriously 2nd-rate. I've seen movies with $20million budgets have better CGI than this movie has.It's a pity because I wanted Black Widow's movie to be good, but Marvel simply ensured that this movie could never be better than a 6/10 no matter what anyone did, even with a 200million dollar budget. It's sad, but this movie doesn't even warrant a single viewing, nevermind any repeated ones. 5/10, bad movie."}, {"reviewer_name": "daniawadhi", "date": "8 July 2021", "text": "This movie was very moving and that post credit scene was everything!"}, {"reviewer_name": "pumba_st", "date": "21 July 2021", "text": "Natasha is simply fearless and amazing.

People wondered why does such a \"strong female character\" get her movie a decade after the inception of the franchise and here's the reason - they never envisioned her as one. When she needed to shine her spandex bottom, to say a quippy line or pose for a group shot - she was appreciated and remembered... by youtube's \"best of black widow\" compilations. But when it comes to origin stories or what can a character do on their own... Well, only one thing was important: that she was russian. So the movie isn't about her as a character. No, it's about her sister and her family. And it's not about her motivations or personality, it's about an evil ruski being an evil ruski. And the problem is... that ruski is probably the best character in the whole movie. And what he does is basically what USA has done for the past 50 years. So all the \"bad man is mad\" had no effect on me. In fact, I merely appreciated the actor's performance. As well as Pugh's best rendition of JarJar Binks.The action is terrible. Editing is atrocious and unwatchable. Fighting is fake and animated. It's basically a Captain Marvel that tries and fails, because you don't win a game by scoring into your own gate. The narrative and the pacing are barebone too, because far too much time gets wasted on, to put it simply, idiotic comedy and what concerns character developed is mostly done by out of place action scenes. Or worse.But I did enjoy the Red Guardian's character. Even if he was written with the all the misandry you could think of. Not as bad as the latest Ghostbuters though. And I kind of appreciated the chemistry between characters. Again - the humor. It's not a tragedy or an action movie, more like a Futurama episode. And I think Black Widow deserved better. Yes, she is russian. Yes, he had an origin story in her comics. Should I divulge that the origin story of Black Panther characters would make modern lefties tear their hair out? Changes are often made to sell the propaganda, and it seems like the respect for the character did not outweigh the necessity of her classic origin.So, no, it's not as bad as Captain Marvel. It's not something to shoot for, like Red Sparrow. It's just a bad movie. One of the many. 200mil$ well-spent.

Your ledgers must be dripping, just gushing red. I couldn't be more proud of you.' Alexei Shostakov (David Harbour): to Natasha and YelenaWhat helps me through the bombs and kicks of super-hero films is the consistent \"family\" theme. It may be whole families or individual members looking for parents or siblings. In Black Widow, Natasha (Scarlett Johannson) is seeking reconciliation with her sister and her parents. BW frames the entire adventure around the family dynamic. Notwithstanding the combative family of Avenger superheroes themselves, this version brings home the importance of real home.Although Black Widow is historically placed between Captain America: Civil War and Avengers: Infinity War, it has its own surfeit of mano-mano fighting and explosions. When the dust settles, Natasha joins forces with her sister, Yelena Belova (Florence Pugh) to find her mother, Melina (Rachel Weisz), and father, Alexei (David Harbour). Things are not as they seem when the daughters do catch up to join forces after some rocky initial actions.The first forty minutes of the family's escape from their idyllic Ohio home are as exciting an opener as you will likely see this summer. Then, as the formula demands, there is a Bond-like megalomaniac, Dreykov (Ray Winstone), whom the girls will target as he dominates other \"widows\" around the world with chemically-induced mind control.Twenty-one years later, Natasha escapes a SWAT team to Norway, then briefly rejoining Yelena in Budapest before they both try to evade an armored vehicle and the menacing Dreykov soldiers who mimic the fighting techniques of their prey-even Avengers.The vials of antidote Yelena steals were designed by Dreykov to erase free will of the world's widows-a McGuffin-like device that is lost amid the chaos. The nice touch is that the sisters not only can knock off this world enemy, but they can also liberate strong young women, a gentle way of introducing the feminist motif without beating the audience with it. After quite capable director Cate Shortland and writer Eric Pearson allow the sisters to reconcile, watch for Yelena mocking Natasha's balletic hair-toss pose. Not all the impact of the heroic epic is explosions.Johansson and Pugh are in the Butch Cassady tradition of buddy bonding, a characterizing that promises future Avengers' sagas to be more humane and endearing.

Natasha Romanoff, aka Black Widow, teams up with her \"other\" family to stop a team of enemy assasins.But, it's not the plot that we care about in these types of movies, it's the characters and the action.

She has this character down and if this is her last go around as this character, she'll got out with her head held high. David Harbour (STRANGER THINGS) is the comic relief of this film as his (somewhat) overweight superhero RED GUARDIAN, tries to fit into his old costume (reminiscent of MR. INCREDIBLE) while Rachel Weisz (Oscar winner for THE CONSTANT GARDNER) is the grounding/realistic character.But all 3 of these take a back seat to the terrific Florence Pugh (Oscar nominated for LITTLE WOMEN a few year's back) as the \"little sister\" of Black Widow. She and Johannson have terrific chemistry together and the writers/directors give Pugh most of the good lines that will lead the audience to be won over by her character.The only blemish I have in the performances of this film is Ray Winstone's rather \"average\" performance as the main bad guy in this film. I don't fault Winstone's performance, I think that it is because the part is underwritten or, worst yet, an afterthought of the writers.Director Cate Shortland (LORE) does a good job keeping the film moving while interspersing the family drama with the action and the humor at a brisk enough clip to keep your interest for the full 134 minutes of this film. It's a good return to the MCU and one that will keep you coming back for more.Which is EXACTLY what the MCU wishes you to do.Letter Grade: A-8 stars (out of 10) and you can take that to the Bank(ofMarquis)"}, {"reviewer_name": "rehmankhilji", "date": "18 July 2021", "text": "Well it is difficult to make every avenger independent character movie a hit.

For over a decade now, that kind of gap in MCU movies was unheard of (we really are spoiled aren't we?), and while the good folks at Marvel been tiding us over with a plethora of mini-series over on Disney+, fans have been chomping at the bit for the silver screen experience once again.Obviously, Black Widow was not designed to shoulder the expectations of Marvel's big return to the movies, and I think fans would be right to keep that in mind. Nonetheless, this is a great blockbuster and standalone outing for the MCU's first female superhero - one who's been long overdue to headline a movie of her own.Black Widow follows the titular hero after the events of the MCU's \"Civil War.\" Already in a precarious situation, Natasha's life gets further complictaed when her distant past gets unexpectedly thrust back into her life.Black Widow was somehow more serious than I expected and more funny than I expected simultaneously. As far as Marvel movies go, this is most comparable to \"Captain America: The Winter Soldier\" in its tone and style. That's fitting, given that the spy thriller genre fits the character like a glove. Still, I think viewers' mileage with the plot may vary. This is due mainly to the villains, whom I found to kind of be duds that could have had greater potential. Additionally, while not an issue per se, the plotting is not overly complex or full of the twists that you might expect given the genre.Where the movie really shines is in the family dynamic that it creates for Natasha. The supporting cast that comprises this odd little unit is fantastic. Florence Pugh in particular, whose other work I have never seen before, was especially endearing and a real standout. The relationships were the best part of the movie for me. They are funny and emotional all at once, and are used to great effect to explore Natasha's past and what makes her tick. Almost since her introduction to these movies 10 years ago, the character has been talking about doing what she does to atone for the mistakes of her past, and we finally get that fleshed out in a way that makes her character arc more substantive.Coming as a surprise to very few, Marvel yet again nails the action. It's full of great set pieces and visceral hand-to-hand combat. One complaint I do have is that our heroes walk away from a couple of situations more easily than they should have, given that they are regular, non-superpowered humans in this universe; this noticeably lowered the tension for me by the end.All in all, I give \"Black Widow\" a 7.5 - it's a flawed but highly entertaining blockbuster that doesn't change the fabric of the MCU, but does finally flesh out one of its more prominent figures."}, {"reviewer_name": "alessio-11472", "date": "9 July 2021", "text": "If you are a fan of Natasha Romanoff, that alone should allow you to enjoy the film. Great action and emotion from all characters. But a lot of this movie is Natasha explaining her past rather then actually showing us. We don't ever get a scene of Natasha and Clint in their Budapest mission, which is something all fans would have loved to see."}, {"reviewer_name": "ethantoy", "date": "9 July 2021", "text": "Black Widow was pretty impressive, and surprisingly well paced for what it was worth. The story was a little too late for its own good to come to fruition, but it was awesome being able to see Black Widow earn her own solo film. Scarlett Johansson played her wonderfully and shown emotional leverage to the character.Florence Pugh was also just as good, if not better, in some parts of this film. She's a rising star, especially coming from Midsommar, directed by Ari Aster. I believe she has much more talent to show to the world overtime.The rest of the film itself is good, it's fun and it's well done as most Marvel movies are. The villain was awesome, and is unquestionably one of the most badass villains to come to the MCU.My only complaints are some of the decisions on timing of the story, and where it takes place- it's pretty incoherent and almost at some point seems to feel convoluted in terms of matching up with the MCU's timeline- but I think they made do with what they could and it doesn't affect it dramatically in the long run. The CGI is also a lot less stellar (which is insane comparing this to Endgame's use of CGI) in this movie which is strange due to the budgeting and income these Marvel films make. You will notice poor CGI in some scenes, but the choreography and set pieces are super epic.All in all, I'd recommend Black Widow for Marvel fans and those that wanted to see their heroine finally get her own screen time, it's a fun, solid watch.

I was so excited for this movie, and the wait is finally over!One of my biggest questions I wanted answered going into this movie was where this falls in the MCU timeline. I was really hoping to see Budapest and its plot because it was referenced in previous MCU films (especially between Black Widow and Hawkeye), but it was never shown. I was really intrigued to see the beginning of their relationship. Sadly though, it was still only referenced. Instead, this primarily takes place directly after the events of Captain America: Civil War where Black Widow turned on Black Panther at the airport.Taskmaster and Red Guardian were two new characters introduced to the audience; however, I really wish that Marvel had given both characters a stronger role and presence in the movie. Taskmaster had a few scenes where I reacted with a jaw dropping \"what just happened\"; Taskmaster knew how to make an entrance. Red Guardian spent too much time reminiscing about his time fighting Captain America in the 80s. But he was still on ice in that time so who was Red Guardian really talking about. When another inmate questioned Red Guardian's claims, he responded by breaking his arm! It made me think that what are the chances that Red Guardian was possibly from an alternate timeline; it is farfetched, but it is still possible.One thing that I really enjoyed and appreciated about this movie was the plot. It did not have the traditional Marvel superhero movie plot. Black Widow was action packed, and I would even argue it was greater than previously produced movies. The only \"dry\" moment of the movie for me was about 10-15 minutes right in the middle. The pace of the plot had significantly decreased in comparison to the rest of the movie.Another aspect of the movie I really enjoyed was Florence Pugh's performance as Yelena Belova. Her character was built in a way that can carry on the Black Widow name in the future, hopefully.Black Widow is a movie that is long overdue. She carried the MCU since her debut in Iron Man 2. As Thor said in Ragnarok, \"respectful appreciation, I think it's great that there is an elite force of women warriors\".

Natasha a spy, a normal human falls off a three storey bulding and hits her head twice on some pipes and gets back up immediately without a scratch.The actors do their part but the script is haywire and there seems to be a lack of creativity from the people who helmed it , everything just comes across as mundane and flat.The villain, well....... Taskmaster shows up occasionally. The film tries to tie Natasha and the villain's stories together but it is done in such an odd\nhaphazard way that ultimately it leaves you feeling frustrated instead of emotionally capturing you.The movie is genuinely uninteresting and is an abysmal send off for one of the most beloved MCU characters and Actors. The editing is fine , the cinematography is bland, the music is forgettable.David Harbour and Florence Pugh may be the only positives in this film along with Scarlett's presence, all three of them have a genuinely good chemistry which does bring a few laughs and emotions from our side.The film has a weird and twisted morality and a clear and obvious undertone which it didn't need and quite frankly leaves a sick taste in your mouth.Don't waste Your time with this , go watch Winter Soldier instead."}, {"reviewer_name": "marc_to", "date": "13 July 2021", "text": "Why does the family have a Russian accent?

It is probably just me, but the movie really had some flaws which are worth mentioning.I don't know if it's comic-based, but the movie starts very promising, it doesn't give you the impression that you watch a movie based on superheroes and I've also liked the idea of having an intro, but the problem is that during the movie, the storyline becomes more and more boring... Not so many action scenes, not so many plot-twists and somehow, the storyline feels forced out and predictable.Another flaw, not so important however like the storyline, are the special effects. Overall, especially at the end of the movie, those effects were very good, but I've noticed some scenes which didn't give you the sense of reality (I have 2 examples here... First example is in the beginning when Natasha's father is lifting that wagon to make clear way for the plane and here I am talking about the fall of this wagon and the second not-so-2021-like special effect is when they had to land with the helicopter... The special effect was so awful, that I've thought that I am watching a cartoon show). Apart of that, everything was fine from this point of view.The movie has another setback too, like the fighting scenes... The fighting scenes are short and unrealistic... I know that is supposed to be a fight between 2 supernatural human beings, however this is not some cheap chinese fighting movie either, where people just fly in the air, without any sense... The movie had too many and pointless acrobatic moves.Despite the fact that the storyline is a little boring, the bad editing of some special effects and the fighting scenes which are a little bit exageratted, \"Black Widow\" it's still worth watching. As I've already said, the idea of an intro has been a very good choice, the soundtrack has been good, the visuals great and the acting good enough. This movie could have been better, because there are older Marvel movies which are a lot more superior to this, but at least it's not boring either."}, {"reviewer_name": "tonyfish-72581", "date": "17 July 2021", "text": "This movie was really disappointing.

I love Marvel, but I always felt most of their characters have terrific back stories that lend to actual story telling beyond the explosions and it is always brushed off. They go through horrible things and the \"say\" they are marked by them and it means everything but they don't act like something actually happened to them. The horrible trauma actually gets brushed off.They did a bit in TFAWS with Bucky having sort of a therapist, but that was even a joke.Here, maybe because it catered more to a female audience, I believe, they actually show that the Red Room was horrible and that it scared this women for life. Yes, it made them awesome, fearless killing machines but it also destroyed their childhood and their overall life and that is what moves the story forward.I read some reviews that say the villain is underwhelming, I think it is actually the best story of all of them because the villain is not this superhuman blowing stuff up; the villain is a normal human that preys on defenseless little girls just so he can gain power. It is the whole organization that destroyed Natasha's and Yelena's life.

It's all heart.No one showed more heart than the star herself..\nWhile many actors might have been tempted to use the executive producer title to insure themselves the spotlight, Scarlett opted to use hers to just make the best movie possible, even setting up a bright future for those who'd take her place. She surrounded herself with first-class talent and made sure everyone had a chance to shine.My only complaint is that this will be our last Black Widow movie with Natasha front and center, but I'm willing to wager all the infinity stones at the TVA that Black Widow 2 will have Scarlett Johansson's name listed among the executive producers.This was a perfect send-off for a beloved character."}, {"reviewer_name": "dave-06306", "date": "10 July 2021", "text": "No quite the film Black Widow deserved but very close.Brilliant cast, especially all of the \"Family\", plenty of humour and decent action.Not as fun as Ragnarok, less action than Winter Soldier but way better than all 3 iron mans, both early thors and the overated black panther.It did a good job of filling in the blanks for Widow's origin and told an interesting story about what makes her tick.It made total sense to me that the she didnt have a big fight with taskmaster at the end, the plot made it pretty obvious why she didnt want that.It would have been a 10 but it looses 1 for an out of place Ray Winstone and for giving me a slither of hope to be crushed all over again seconds later when the final whistle in the end credits scene wasnt returned.Bye Nat gonna miss you.Hi Yelena you seem cool."}, {"reviewer_name": "ssm-60170", "date": "10 July 2021", "text": "This movie have everything\nSadness comedy non stop action suspense worth to wait\nI didn't get disappointed just go WATCH right now."}, {"reviewer_name": "suusvsummeren", "date": "10 July 2021", "text": "I absolutely loved this movie.

I say this as a man myself; They'll praise male heroes for having very simple plot lines, but the same ones say this movie had a 'boring' plot. Black Widow had themes of human trafficking & the dehumanization of young women, and apparently that's boring for them because it's advocating for real global issues and not a story about something cheesy..Anyways, action sequels were top notch that was not a surprise considering the well-known stunt coordinators they hired. Casting was close to perfect, Scarlett's had 10 years to truly embody Natasha & this film was a perfect send off, it actually made me like Natasha more, she was never one of my favourites always just in the back for me but after the movie I was proven wrong. Helena as everyone else says was FANTASTIC, I am very excited to see her future in the MCU what a great addition! The opening credit was different from any Marvel movie we've seen, soundtrack was spot on.Only reason I give it a 9 is because Taskmaster was a wasted potential, he was such a well-written Villian in the comics they could've done much more with him.When reading bad reviews, remember that most of people's opinions are formulated on other's opinions - it's a hate chain, it's not real. Watch the movie for yourself first and then decide, but I personally do think the hate is biased. Iron Man 2 was not a good movie, weak Villian & story but didn't get nearly as much hate as this because it Tony Stark/Iron Man, but this film doesn't come CLOSE to that movie.

The franchise is by no means perfect, but when you look back on every film collectively, culminating with Avengers: Endgame, you can't really do anything but praise the effort and the outcome. Ever since they announced they were making a Black Widow movie, I was honestly scratching my head as to why they would go backwards, seeing as the character had died during the events of the massive climax. Well, after a year of delays, it has now been released, but I'm still wondering that same question. Even though this film is good overall, it just feels like it should've been released about three or four years ago.Taking place in between the events of Captain America: Civil War and Avengers: Infinity War, Natasha Romanoff finds herself on the run from the government and is being pursued by something directly related to her past. This in turn provides the backstory for the character, which was nice but also felt like just an elaboration of things we learned about her slowly throughout the franchise. Again, I was entertained by Black Widow from start to finish, but it just kind of felt unnecessary. Where this film surprisingly shines is in the supporting cast.Scarlett Johansson has always been likeable as this character, but I honestly feel that the family dynamic between her sister and parents was the best stuff in the film. Her sister Yelena (Florence Pugh) and father Alexei (David Harbour) stole the movie every time either of them was on-screen. David Harbour is clearly just having a blast with this character and it's very fun to watch. On the other side, Florence Pugh was easily the best part of the movie for me. Her performance, along with her bond with her sister just elevated the film for me. If Black Widow was simply about Natasha confronting her past, alone, this movie would have been incredibly boring. Sadly though, it does become slightly boring at times.There were a few instances where things kind of feel like they're happening because nothing exciting is going on. It really just feels like Marvel wanted to give Scarlett Johanssen her own movie before saying goodbye to the character, but also leaving the door open for someone else to take up the Black Widow title. It's also kind of difficult to dive into the villain subplot without giving anything away, but when it's revealed who is under the Task Master outfit, I both enjoyed and hated it. It has a nice payoff but the character until that point always felt underused. Marvel has had a pretty solid track record lately with their villains, but even though a threat is present here, there never really seems to be any big stakes.Overall, I enjoyed watching Black Widow because I like the character, I like Scarlett Johansson, and I loved the family aspect, mainly a couple of notable scenes in the second half of the film. Even after this film explored her past, I still feel like we didn't quite get enough from this character before saying goodbye. On top of that, since everything else in the series seems to be building on or moving past the events of Avengers: Endgame, this movie deserved to be released during the time period it takes place in. A film like Captain Marvel jumped back far enough that it wasn't really an issue and it was a brand new character as well. This film felt like it was trying to accomplish the same thing but ultimately felt like I was sitting in the theatre around 2017. In the end, I still give this film a positive grade and recommend checking it out if you have followed the franchise until this point, but other than introducing one or two new characters that we definitely haven't seen the last of, Black Widow feels a little too distant from the currently Marvel Cinematic Universe, as it stands now."}, {"reviewer_name": "msamiuddin98", "date": "9 July 2021", "text": "I really liked the movie, I was hesitant to watch it because of some reviews I saw on YouTube, some of the reviewers were harsh and really thrashed the movie.

I do not think it dragged at all unlike some other reviews I read. If anything it felt short. In fact, I paused the movie to use the bathroom and was surprised that I was already about 70-75% through the movie. Could have sworn there was still half left. I also quite liked the family dynamic between Nat and her \"family\". Especially between her and Yelena. I really bought into that bond. And speaking of Yelena, Florence Pugh is phenomenal in this. She is just so funny, charming, empathetic and kick-ass. And she truly gets some of the best lines (both funny, and emotional). I also felt the film was easy to follow along for the most part. Only one scene towards the end that I think needed to be expanded upon more. But overall I really liked the story of this film. To me, I felt like the film was exploring themes of women's rights, the patriarchy and also a touch of domestic violence but in a comic book/action way. But I really liked what they had to say and it connected with me.My only big complaint I have is that the action felt too over the top at times. Reminded me of Mission Impossible 5 in that regards. If you loved that film, great. For me...it got kind of ridiculous. It makes sense with a character like Thor who is a demi God and super powerful but Nat (besides being well trained) is just a regular human. There was numerous points where I was like \"There is no way you would get up and walk after that\". But, movie got to movie I guess. Also the Taskmaster wasn't as notable as other villains have been. It does provide good character development for Nat though. So at least that's a plus even if the character in itself is kind of forgettable.If I had to rank it somewhere on the MCU movie list, I think it would fall somewhere around 9. Might have to do some re-watches again and maybe re-rank. I feel confident in my top 5, and I feel confident that I liked it more than the majority of the MCU films out there (is this 24th one now?), not that those are bad though. But there is some potential wriggle room.

Though it deserves substantial praise for what it is - a consistently engaging, tonally different, and largely grounded film that ensures you care for its titular character despite acknowledging she no longer exists in the MCU. It is well directed and acted, all-stars giving their best, and having a singular theme running for its entire runtime - the widespread abuse against women and the scarcity of people working against it. Sure, it doesn't go all in showing the iniquity that breeds amongst us, but it does far better than what we usually expect from a typical Marvel film.The beginning, particularly, and the ending, hits the rousing notes that you feel while reading the comics devoted to the character. It all culminates nicely, bridging the timeline of Natasha Romanoff well from Civil War to Infinity War while also giving us a few likeable characters to follow ahead in MCU's next phase.I'd honestly expect a disappointing film, assuming it would feel too belated. But I am surprised as well as I am impressed by how it ends up being an overall good movie, having great rewatch value and for being far, far better than at least six MCU movies (Captain Marvel, Ant-man and the Wasp, Black Panther, Doctor Strange, Thor: The Dark World, and The Incredible Hulk).Watch if you can on an IMAX screen.

It is smaller-scaled in terms of action spectacle, but fans who care about Black Widow will appreciate the character development.Black Widow fills in the missing narrative gaps for its title character between all the Avengers films. We learn about Natasha Romanoff's dark past in Russia before she joined the Avengers. In the first Avengers, Black Widow talks about having red on her ledger and that is dealt with here in a dramatically satisfying manner which retroactively deepens her story arc from Infinity War. The idealist in me wishes this origin story was told earlier and wasn't an afterthought on the Marvel timeline.Director Cate Shortland, who has a background in indie dramas, brings a more delicate touch that veers away from the usual Marvel aesthetic. The cinematography is shot in an intimate fashion that pulls up close to the actor's faces, which translates to a Bourne Identity shaky quick-cut style in the fight scenes. The musical score takes its cue from old political thrillers. Overall, the film feels more intimate and hand-made.There are fewer jokes, something which I appreciated. Black Widow is not a comedy. In fact, it's one of the more tonally serious Marvel installments. The few gags that are there do land and function more like tension breakers than comedic quips.Scarlett Johansson delivers a solid performance in her final outing. Her portrayal here feels like Johannson's own vision of the character. Natasha is not dressed or photographed in an overtly sexual way. She just is a capable Avenger solving her own problems. The Natasha in this film is much more vulnerable than we've seen before. It seems like the note Johannson wants to leave on and she accomplishes that.David Harbour as the Red Guardian, a Russian version of Captain America who is forsaken by his country, was funny as the comedy relief. His character left more to be desired.It is Florence Pugh who steals the show as Yelena Belova. She brings gravitas and communicates her character's dimensions under limited screentime, quickly establishing herself as the most compelling new Marvel character post-Infinity War. The sister story between Natasha and Yelena was well-executed. I look forward to seeing Pugh's next outing as Yelena.Like in most superhero fare, Black Widow struggles between what the film is thematically about versus the commercial expectations it has to deliver. The family drama between Johansson, Pugh, Harbour, and Weisz is easily the best part. With all the commercial box-ticking, the film is too overwhelmed to sink its teeth in exploring this broken family dynamic.At one point, William Hurt's Thaddeus Ross, who is chasing Natasha Romanoff for crimes against the Sokova Accords, feels more like a representation of the Disney-Marvel conglomerate chasing down Scarlett Johansson as she sneakily weaves an arthouse family drama beneath this superhero movie.The film could have used fewer action sequences and traded that time for more dramatic scenes of the family working out their issues. There were a few fights that seemed unmotivated and I am sure the director would undoubtedly agree.Marvel Studios has gotten the whole world to care about all these characters now. Everybody now sits so obediently waiting for the end credits scene. We've seen science, aliens, gods, and magic. Marvel has us in the seats already.

She felt that it was incredible, I'm a bit more on the fence. I disagree with people giving it 1 star reviews, as it really isn't all that bad. Even the weakest links in the MCU (The Dark World, Iron Man 2, Captain Marvel) are much better than 1 star and this is leaps ahead of them. Even if its the worst of the MCU movies, it still deserves at least a 5/10.Let's break this down into 2 main categories, the good and the bad.GoodPugh is incredible and so damn likeable as Yelena, if Marvel want to make her the new Black Widow moving forward, absolutely no complaints here.The opening 2 acts are really well done, especially the first 15 minutes and the opening credits. It started off great.The soundtrack is excellent.The action is fun, Marvel movies are designed to be enjoyable popcorn action movies and this certainly delivered.The BadTaskmaster. I actually wasn't mad about the gender swap, Taskmaster doesn't need to be a bloke to be as effective as he is in the comics. My problem is Taskmaster is a fantastic villain in the comics, and unfortunately wasn't done justice with how she was written.The 3rd act has some pretty below par CGI, and honestly just feels a bit weak compared to the tone the opening act set.-Johanson doesn't really get to star here. Black Widow deserved her own movie half a decade ago and thats probably when this movie should have come out.Overall, this is a good, if forgettable entry into the MCU.

This seemed like the typical superhero movie to me. Most of my superhero movie ratings started at 10 and went down to 6 because at first I was impressed with the action and special effects. But over time it just became the same old thing over and over again --- great action and special effects. Silly dialogue and plot. This movie is no different.My only real complaint is the same with all these superhero movies --- the sound. The loud parts are really loud. And the low volume parts are really low. I made the mistake of starting this move late on a week night in an apartment building. I didn't want to disturb the neighbors. So I was constantly running the volume up to 80/100 for the low volume parts. All the way down to 15/100 for the high volume parts. (I eventually just gave up and kept it around 20-25/100.)There are lots of heavy eastern European accents in this movie. And lots of mumbling, whispering and low talking. And of course lots of screaming, yelling, explosions and loud music. And I didn't have closed captioning available. So if I didn't miss half the dialogue, I missed more than half.But apparently it didn't really make any difference. I got the general story. Natasha Rominoff (Scarlett Johansson) was raised in a fake family of Russian spies with a mother, a father and a sister. They are based covertly in Ohio. Once their cover is blown, they escape to Cuba where immediately the two girls are put in a spy training program. And the parents return to their normal adult spy lives.21 years later, they find themselves back together again. The girls are resentful they didn't have a normal upbringing. After a family dinner --- where once again, I couldn't understand a word anybody was saying --- they all decide spylife ain't working for them anymore. And the head spy is kind of a jerk. So they plan to bring it all down, and kill the head spy. The rest is all action and special effects.I streamed this movie in high definition, and at a high speed. I thought the action and special effects were great. At least as good as any other superhero movie.7/10 for me. Not the best superhero movie.

There are other titles that are even really good like Civil War. This was not even close.The main complaint I have is the waste of a classic villain. Taskmaster's real name is Tony Masters, not the complete mess of a new character origin that they created for NO REASON. This has major Iron Man 3 vibes in a way with the Mandarin treatment. Not only did they needlessly butches a beloved Marvel character's identity but they're only in the movie for what feels like 10 minutes?! What even is this??? I get it, it's not Thanos but REALLY????Next on the list, we have the typical \"Trailer Syndrome\" where 90% of what you saw in the trailers was the best of the movie. There are a handful of decent scenes (action or not) that aren't crammed into the trailer, but ultimately what you saw is what you got. This again includes 90% of what little we see of Taskmaster, who I will remind you is NOT actually Taskmaster but a complete reinvention to fit the movie's narrative.Moving on with the issues we now have bad Russian accents. Draykov was good, very convincing performance and accent. Everyone else's? Trash. I'm sorry but it's true. It was almost comical. If you're going to have an Avengers spin-off with \"Russian roots\" then at least make the cast more convincingly Russian. It's almost like they all took Rosetta Stone for two weeks and said \"I got it!\" Harbour's is the worst, it's almost like he was just trying to be funny.Lastly I will leave you with this. Why? Just why? What were they thinking when they shipped this? The movie feels so rushed and incomplete that it's just an embarrassment to even call it an entry to the Avengers series. The only MCU movie to date I haven't seen is Captain Marvel which many claim is the worst, but my God... this cannot be much better if that's the case. I understand Covid likely had an effect on production and this and that and blah blah blah but still... how did the billion dollar prowess of Marvel and Disney say \"yup looks good let's print this\" without even questioning all of the things above? It's honesty laughable.On the plus side, Scarlett (like always) killed it. She basically carried the movie which otherwise was mediocre. Without her I swear I would hit 4/10 without even thinking about it but she really shined. You could tell she enjoyed making this and continuing to breathe life into the character.The CGI was good but not nearly dynamic enough for MCU glory. The action was good but definitely unsatisfying. So many opportunities missed. So many missteps that could have been easily avoided. Yelena, while fitting into combat well and mildly entertaining, had many half hearted attempts at humor that mostly fell flat. Strong start that just goes slowly downhill into smoldering disappointment.One more time I'll say it. You had one of the best villains in all in the comic universe and completely botched it. Taskmaster got the Black Mask treatment with unlimited potential but not nearly enough screen time.What a shame."}, {"reviewer_name": "wetmars", "date": "10 July 2021", "text": "Where to begin? I love Black Widow as ever than before. Her character was alright, but at least we got her character redeemed. I love the sisterhood between her and Yelena, even the family traits. Glad to see one of my favorite actors from Stranger Things. He did a fantastic job at performing. Look, I know nothing about Taskmaster from the comics. I'm fine with what they have done to her. Sometimes, we can't get full comic portrayals. Every Marvel movie can't promise that. Decent origin story between the sisters. I find the Widow Program somewhat unsettling. I see what the writers wanted to do with the movie not being a normal MCU movie. I think they wanted to redeem Black Widow's character with honor, thus answering Tony's question if she even had a family. I think I was too harsh on complaining that the film should have been released sometime after Captain America: Civil War. I do wish they had more menace to the main villain. Of course, the actor had an astounding performance after all. Great action, cinematography,Speaking about the film, I want to discuss the post-credit scene. What a god damn shocker. I am looking forwards to the Hawkeye TV Show. Chills. Overall, this film might not be for others whose expectations were really high. I thought this film was gonna suck, but it didn't in my opinion.EDIT: I wanted to add more, so why not? I think my most favorite scene from Black Widow would be the powerful opening montage. It was heavily emotional and dark. Natasha had a F-up childhood. I wouldn't be surprised if Marvel is heading for a maturer tone. I can't forget that scene when Yelena did the iconic Black Widow pose, LOL. \"Ugh, that was disgusting.\" even when Natasha broke her nose, then fixed it. I felt that.

Some scenes are totally useless or overexposed to point that you get cringed by it.Its not really that bad, but because of those plotholes, hit-and-miss jokes and fighting its hard to call good movie, it really feelt like one of those action movies that you watch on TV in boring Saturday in the middle of day."}, {"reviewer_name": "BooBooLyon", "date": "10 July 2021", "text": "Okay, so I watched after I waited for 2 YEARS and it's clearly better than I expected.

That would be a waste to not see her anymore.Also, I don't know why but I feel like they could've done more with Alexei/Red Guardian. Because, despite his funny scenes, he doesn't appear that much.The final battle is explosive and all but there is not really a fight, like the Red Room explodes, Natasha saves Yelena in the air after she killed Dreykov. Okay. But, where is the big fight. There's more fight on the previous scene that the final battle, like in Homecoming.

I was already emotionally attached with the character of Black Widow, and this movie introduced us with her second family. Few may find the emotional portion of the movie a little low but for me it was beautiful. The action scenes and its cinematography is top notch and the background music gives it more life. The CGI of the movie matches the level MCU has made for themselves. Scarlet Johanson is so perfect as Black Widow and we are going to miss her a lot as Black Widow. Florence Pugh as Yelena is so perfect hats off to the casting directors. It will be a delight to see Florence portraying Yelena and how she fits the shoe of Natasha. David Harbour as Alexi is so convincing that he makes us believe this funny character to be the nemesis of Captain America.Talking about the demerit of the movie, the antagonist of the movie isn't as frightening as he should have.

A solid actioner (some have opined it feels like Captain America: The Winter Soldier lite) which feels more of an obligation than something organic still manages to entertain beside itself since the only MCU product that's been seen has been the Disney + offerings so anything on the big black screen would be viewed almost as a rite of release than anything else. Pugh & Harvour manage to steal almost every scene they're in while Scarjo's cutaways have a 'this is my family' shrug to them but being this is essentially a sacrificial lamb for the Mouse House to see how their big performers will do in our current Covid nation, we could do worse (live action Mulan, anyone?).

There was plenty of action, but there was also plenty of character development.The one mistake that Marvel made that really hurt this movie is the timing. This movie is NOT a prequel/origin story, it is a character supplement that should have been released in theaters before Infinity War was released--but don't worry, it doesn't spoil anything about Infinity War and beyond. If anything, it does explain some of Natasha's motivations throughout the rest of the timeline through End Game. People expected a prequel/origin story, but this movie wasn't really either of those. That isn't bad, but Hollywood keeps making the same mistake with prequel/origin story style movies over and over again. A good movie(s) is released, people love the characters, and the bits and pieces of each character develop a preconceived idea with the audience of what any prequel/origin story should be like. Once the studio releases the movie, people are often disappointed because it strays away from how a character is portrayed to the audience. Now in the case of Black Widow, this isn't really a major problem, but the studios probably could have advertised this movie a bit different to avoid the prequel/origin story syndrome that plagues most popular films.The movie is about 10% backstory of how Natasha was indoctrinated into the Red Room, and the rest of the movie is about Natasha looking to set things right from her past. You'll get some exposition here and there to help fill in some blanks, and that is all that is really needed for the storyline. To be frank, I honestly don't think the finer details of the Red Room and Natasha's actual training needed to be filmed or explained in great detail--and the studio made the right decision in that aspect. What happened to her during her training, as told in the other movies, is enough to paint the picture of just how brutal and inhumane her life was. There's no need to dig into that. If you can't appreciate a character story without seeing a bunch of gore and disgusting treatment, then this movie isn't for you.I would recommend this movie to those that haven't seen Infinity War and End Game yet. I would recommend watching this before those as it really does add to the continuity and Natasha's character overall."}, {"reviewer_name": "dreamingwolf-01253", "date": "25 July 2021", "text": "I wanted to like but just couldn't get into it.

It's nice to see it.+All of the scenes involving Natasha with her family are honestly really sweet, and I wish we could get more scenes like that in other MCU films.+As per usual with the MCU, the performances are really solid. Scarlett Johansson is once again iconic as Black Widow. David Harbour does an excellent job as the Red Guardian, but the real standout is Florence Pugh as Yelena Belova. She is fantastic in this movie and makes Yelena an instantly lovable character that I'm sure will be adored by anyone who watches this film.+The score was really well done, lots of solid music for the OST.+I like the grounded, spy-thriller feel of it. Reminds me of CA: TWS.+Some of the action was cool.CONS:\n-This whole movie just feels underwhelming, mostly because the movie feels like it's just too little, WAY too late. That isn't necessarily the movie's fault, but it still hurts the experience nonetheless.-All of the development Natasha goes through in this film, everything that is set up with her and her family, all feels utterly pointless given that this movie takes place before ENDGAME, and we already know where she ends up in that film, so it ruins any of the development.-A lot of the action was bogged down by some shockingly bad CGI, especially given the MCU's track record when it comes to CGI.-I cant help but feel this movie is extremely over-expository at times. It honestly makes this movie feel boring in spots.-Taskmaster's portrayal in this film is one of the most disappointing things in the entire MCU and is downright disrespectful to the character as he is in the source material. I won't spoil anything for anyone who hasn't seen it. Just know that longtime fans will be GREATLY disappointed.-This movie was very forgettable. Normally, the MCU is great at crafting films with memorable quotes, and memorable action sequences. But this film has none of that, and I honestly forgot most of it not even a day after I watched it.OVERALL: BLACK WIDOW was a fairly disappointing return to the movies from the MCU.

However, in this movie all of that is thrown out the window! She is practically invincible! Also in regards to Taskmaster, the character is probably the most disappointing MCU villain of all time, even worst than the Manderin from Iron Man 3. Without getting into spoilers, the decision they made did fit the story, but the character of taskmaster should've been replaced with another. The best aspect of this movie is easily Yelena, she steals every scene she's in, making Natasha feel like a sidekick in her own movie! Red Guardian is also a great character but severely under utilized. The main villain is also extremely lame. This movie contains all of Marvels reused tropes without adding too much new.

But I strongly believe that it should have been released somewhere between 2010 and 2012, which then makes me ask myself, why? What was the point of this movie? We already know how Black Widow goes out in Endgame, so there was little to no tension as to the fate of the character. I am not sure how this movie will ultimately build up into a much larger phase 4 of the marvel universe, but I guess we just wait and see. There are some ideas here and there and some few things they might do in the future, but generally, this movie can be easily scrapped out and nothing will lack in the grand scale of the universe. But I am getting ahead of myself.I know I sound so negative towards the movie but I actually enjoyed it. I found it entertaining and at no point did I switch my mind off from it. It has good things going on for it, but it has its flaws, flaws that too big to ignore and to some extent, have affected my overall rating of the film. Before I begin though, there are some things I would like to put across first. There are two ways to look at this movie, as a spy action film and as a marvel movie. This review will focus on the latter because that's what the movie was made to be, a marvel movie. And probably because it would fail hilariously as an actual spy movie. Another thing is that I have watched this movie only twice and so, maybe in future some of my opinions may change. Lastly, this review is only my opinion and what I thought about the movie on a personal note, so feel free to disagree.To start off, I will go through some of the positives. The acting was solid in this movie. Scarlet Johansson is Black Widow the way we know Black Widow. She plays the role to perfection like she always has. Florence Pugh is brilliant as Yelena. In the hands of another actress, the character may have easily come out as cocky and annoying, but Florence handles it perfectly well, and the character is actually likable. But the highlight is David Harbour's Alexei. This guy steals the show, literally in every scene he is in. He is what you might say is the comic relief of the movie, but has a decent amount of story that he does not feel shoehorned into the movie.Another thing I respect this movie for is that it does not pander to a certain demography of people. Despite the lead roles being females, the movie does not feel like it is entitled and it actually worked very in portrayal of the main characters as human being and not instruments of agenda. Unlike other recent pieces of media like Ghostbusters (2016), the Batwoman TV show and Captain Marvel.However, the biggest positive I saw in this movie was the action scenes. I really loved the action sequences. The fights were well choreographed, despite the obviously noticeable stunt doubles. Those scenes were the most engaging scenes in the movie for me. The action scenes were well done and it felt like a marvel movie, in a positive way. I wish to also add that this film is also technically brilliant and it looks impressive. The score of the movie is also solid.Oh, and before I forget, this might be minor, but I really loved the post credit scene. That's the much I can say about it without spoiling any if it. But I really loved it and I am waiting to see how they advance with that certain plotline.Now we go to the negatives, which unfortunately are more that there were positives.First, I didn't like the setting of the movie. This movie is set after the events of Captain America: Civil War and before the events of Infinity War. But maybe I missed something in the marketing, but I was expecting a story that took place before Natasha joined the Avengers of even SHIELD. So how weird it was to see one of the original Avengers getting a solo movie after we got a couple of ensemble movies. And to make the matters worse, we already know that Black Widow dies in endgame, making this movie just a product of fan demands. Another thing is that, by playing around with the timeline, a lot of things don't make sense. Like I said earlier, the movie would have been better if it came out in phase 1 of marvel films. As it stands, there are some plot holes. For instance, all the destruction that supposedly takes place in this movie will reasonably attract a lot of attention from the world or at least the Avengers or even SHIELD. And you would expect for such things to be mentioned in Infinity War. Well, that is if there was a plan, but we now all know that this movie was just a mere afterthought. Another thing is, where was Tony Stark? I mean, Natasha chose to fight for Tony's side in Civil War, so you would expect that he would be there for her when she needed him too, but too bad RDJ has no more contracts with marvel. Last but not least, I remember the ending of civil war, just right about the time Tony was reading Steve's letter, he was notified that the imprisoned avengers were escaping and then we saw Steve Rogers in the facilities where they were being held, suggesting that he was the one orchestrating the operation. But at the end of Black Widow, she says that she has to head and break out the other Avengers from prison. So, who did what? Was it Steve or Natasha? Or both? I get that this movie explains how they got the aircraft they had, and maybe they did it together, but it all feels forced. It didn't feel planned and even if you watch this movie immediately after Civil War, it still wouldn't make sense. Even more the reason I felt like this movie was an unnecessary entry in the franchise. I am sure there would be a lot more inconsistencies if carefully examined, but you get the point.The other thing I didn't like about this movie was the protagonist. Don't get me wrong, Johansson does a really good job with what she had, but the character of Black Widow has some flaws when it comes to the writing. First, I don't know if it is only me, what made Black Widow so cool was the mystery that was the person. We didn't know who she was, where she came from, how she got all the skills she has and what her personal motivations were. She was more of the person who got things done and she was such a badass. I had even thought that Natasha Romanov was her alias and not her real name. So, a movie like this may decide to go one of two ways. Either keep Black Widow a mystery that she was, or explore her origins. If you choose the latter, you should go all the way and explore the depths of the character. This movie seems to linger in between. It attempts to explore the origins but does not give enough depth, which ended up making me feel empty. The movie is somewhere between being an origin and being an action adventure and unfortunately it does not give enough of both. There were a lot of good ideas that were unfortunately not well developed. For instance, I would have loved to see the dynamics between the Red Room and SHIELD. Also, this was a movie where Nick Fury would have perfectly fitted. There is also a lot of mention of a past mission between Black Widow and Hawkeye whose outcome played a huge role in the plot of this film. I honestly would have preferred to see that movie instead of what we got here. The Hungarian mission would have made a perfect adventure movie. Another thing is that the movie establishes huge world changing stakes, the plot with all the widows, that I couldn't help but think that this mission would have been something for the entire Avengers team and not just one character, especially not this late in the franchise.Still on the point of the protagonist, the main character felt shallow. There was no personal motivation, no personal driving force for her to undertake the task like she did and the character does not change. She is the same when the movie ends as she was when the movie began. She doesn't learn or unlearn anything and this was a letdown. Let's compare to the other solo movies for the original avengers. Tony in Iron Man had to deal with the fact that his own weapons were being used for war and destruction mostly among innocent people, Steve Rogers in Captain America was all about standing up against bullies, Thor learnt how to be noble and worthy and even Bruce in the Incredible Hulk had to learn to control the monster inside which he did by the end of the movie. Then we have Black Widow, who ends up being the same as she was in the other previous movies.The next problem I had with this movie is the antagonist. The main antagonist is barely existent save for the third act. They say a movie is as good as its villain. Well, we don't see the villain until late in the film. This is detrimental as there is no sense of conflict in the movie. They attempt to fit in a lot of interaction between the hero and the villain in their brief encounter towards the end but it doesn't make up for his absence throughout the entire film. There is however, Taskmaster. I hear this villain has a lot of depth in the comics and is widely criticized for being disappointing in this film. I am not well familiar with the Taskmaster in the comics, so for me, I felt like she was a tool to keep the plot moving. Its like a programmed robot chasing our main characters around. It's a spectacle to see the fight scenes involving the Taskmaster, but that is it. She adds nothing else to the movie and actually doesn't even cause any real damage. She had no development at all and therefore I ended up not caring.Another issue I had with the film is that in lacked some originality. To me, the final battle was too similar to the final battle of Captain America: The Winter Soldier. Even the relationship between Steve and Bucky in Captain America was too similar to Natasha and Antonia in Black Widow. Not only the final scene but the entire movie gave the Winter Soldier vibes and that is not all good despite The Winter Soldier being one of the best marvel movies. I felt like this movie didn't have an identity to stand on its own."}, {"reviewer_name": "omeralaa", "date": "13 July 2021", "text": "As the perspective is everything in reviewing movies I should explain myself from MCU movies, I'm an 80% MCU fan and 20% DCU fan, on the other hand, I'm a 60% DC characters fan and 40% Marvel characters fan, and of course \"Black Widow\" isn't in my top 10 favorite Marvel characters list -which is doesn't really exist but if I did it someday I'd never put Black Widow in it-\nSo you should know that I'm not the number one Black Widow fan and so does the majority of people because she has never been introduced as a main character on the silver screen before.So if this was not an MCU movie, I wouldn't watch itBut let put that beside and let's talk cinema.The action was lousy, and I blame whoever put Cate Shortland in this project, she has never made action movies before and that's her first time to be on a blockbuster movie, and unfortunately, she failed to give us a single good action sequence.There's a scene, Scarlett Johansson's stunt double face is fully clear and much more stupid things.Editing was trying to hide the actresses' laziness and the director's lack of experience by fast cutting the scenes to hide stunt doubles faces but that made the action sequences experience even worse, I almost had a headache.The movie's CGI is cheap, it really can harm your eyes, in 2021 and they did that how come? Hands down it's one of the worst.I saw a lot of people talking about Florence Pugh's performance, and that surprised me, not if she was bad or something but you guys saw better performance than David Harbour's? He stole the show\nHe's the best thing in the movie, his comedy scenes killed me, honestly without him I'd rate the movie 4/10\nScarlett Johansson's performance is Scarlett doing Black Widow, not Scarlett doing Nicole from \"Marriage Story\": A lot of superhero poses and 0% effort of doing action scenes without a stunt double.Rachel Weisz's performance was just meh.In any movie -especially a superhero one- I'd love to see a good villain like Thanos or Loki and so on.In this movie, I saw a bad-written one, he has absolutely no motive for his actions, I know he's a metaphor for masculinity and how a lot of men shutting females' mouths and control their actions, but the metaphor wasn't enough, I wished for more, I wished for a better character with real motive.In the end, it's not a bad movie, but it shall have been a better one."}, {"reviewer_name": "tom-vaines", "date": "12 July 2021", "text": "Great to see a marvel film back in the big screen!Set just after captain America civil war it shows the black widow(Scarlett johansson) as a fugitive for breaking the sokovia accords.

I liked Florence Pugh as she did deadly killer/little sister very well, Olga Kurylenko needn't have been in it, Ray Winston (who I love usually) was an odd choice and was under used, Rachel Weisz seemed bored and David Harbour did well with what he was given but was basically an idiot.The story was fine, if a little silly and the first half was a lot better than the second half.Overall, it was an entertaining (if not gripping) way to spend a couple of hours and feel that if it was released 4 or 5 years ago then it would have had the benefit of the MCU hype but as this is now in essence a stand alone movie it was very average."}, {"reviewer_name": "pauldeg-37971", "date": "10 July 2021", "text": "My wife and I sat and watched this on a Saturday.

Natasha's future death in End Game does not reduce the stakes of the plot at all. Her sister, Yelena's complex feelings is very well portrayed by Florence Pugh. She has to switch between innocence and vengence throughout the movie and the duality of her character is the best part of the film. The 'pose' joke also made me laugh. I like how the outfits of hers aren't hypersexualised for the male gaze. Taskmaster felt intimating and terrifying in the first two acts. Throughout the film, I'm constantly intrigued.However, the film fails to meet up my expectations. It is common knowledge that the movie should have released after Civil War. When we finally got her solo film, it even got delayed for a year. Additionally, it was marketed as a spy thriller action movie that resembles Captain America: the Winter Soldier (aka the best MCU film). Perhaps it's due to these premises that I had my hopes up. The plot was not memorable and the editing of the action scenes were sometimes confusing to me. The third act felt poorly designed and predictable. During the confrontation with the villain, there is an 'obstacle' that was dealt a minute later with a flashback scene, it seemed very straightforward and childish. Scenes with Black Widow's private contractor male friend also seemed pointless and dragged. It's another generic superhero film which the good guys beats the bad guys, and this brings nothing new to the table. A darke, serious tone would have suited Black Widow more. Sadly, she had a greater spotlight in Winter Soldier than in her own solo movie.Considering this is Scarlett Johansson's last Marvel movie, it is more focused on others rather than Black Widow herself. I expected a heartfelt, emotional ending but instead we got an abrupt one.

And this film gives us an idea of why she decided on her sacrifice in Endgame.She was done a raw deal in many of the Avengers films.

It is in part an origin story, but it is also in part Romanov cleaning up some lose ends, but also providing a fitting farewell to the a character that we are unlikely to see again. Mind you, it wasn't as action packed as some of the other films that I've seen from them, but I guess it was designed more to flesh out Romanov's backstory, and to give us a better idea as to who she is, and where she came from (namely because she has really only been hanging around on the outer edges, much like Hawkeye).Actually, that is an interesting thing, because the film also seems to be setting up a story with regards to Hawkeye, which seems to be coming out shortly, though it looks like he will basically have his own series as opposed to a film dedicated to him. Mind you, there are still some things that are mentioned, such as his role in bringing Romanov over to the West and initiating her as a member of Shield.The movie begins in 1995 where Romanov lives with her sister and mother in the United States. Their father returns home and tells them that they need to leave immediately, and suddenly their quiet lives in the United States are upended as the two girls are taken away from their parents and initiated into a program known as the Red Room - where Soviet super-spies are trained (and it is interesting that they are all women, but then again they do tend to make the perfect honey pots).I didn't find this film as funny as some of the others. In fact, it seeems as if they tried to be funny, but in a lot of cases simply fell flat. This was particularly the case with Alexei. It was clear that he was supposed to be the comic relief, but in my mind it really didn't seem to work out that way. However, it was certainly interesting to see Harbour now inducted into the Marvel Cinematic Universe, and I suspect that this isn't the last that we will be seeing of them, though I also note that Marvel has gone down the way of releasing limited series, which I suspect has a lot to do with them attempting to promote their Disney + service.It also sort of felt to be a bit like Wonder Woman, though I suspect this has something to do with me watching a run down of it recently. Sure, Romanov is a spy, and she was working for the Soviets, or at least an ex-Soviet organistion. Then there is also this idea about how one's childhood is taken away, but not only that but their womanhood as well. This is noted when they speak about the hysterectomy, and that the womb is removed so as to keep them emotionally stable.However, I did feel that this film was somewhat drier than others, though I really did like the opening credits, which was seriously one of the best that I have seen in any of the Marvel Movies so far, not only because of the slowed down, haunting version of Smells Like Teen Spirit, but also the way they fast forwarded through Natasha's time in the Red Room."}, {"reviewer_name": "humanass", "date": "11 July 2021", "text": "Wtf us this atrocious fast and furious woke Garbage marvel?

Instead it's more so just one individual story of Natasha's. One that lets a character we know is dead, who sacrificed herself, a moment of happiness and realization that she does in fact have family (2 even!). Honestly, this wasn't anything but a found family and sisterly bonding movie, and I'm here for it.I loved the addition of Alexi and Yelena. Her \"mother\" Melina, never quite grew on me like the others did, but I still think the actress did the part well.I've seen critics say it was released too late, and I'd disagree. I think the knowledge that despite this outing and the family message, that Black Widow dies *because* she sacrifices herself, really adds this air to it. This is the one critic commentary I can still understand. Outside of the after credit scene, this movie could have technically been released during the proper order.I've also seen it being bashed for the level of CGI. I have no idea why this is even a complaint, considering half of marvel's movies are filmed in a green screen room. Does it have a huge CGI scene at the end? Yes. Does it have more than any other Marvel movie? Absolutely not. I'd say it has some of the lesser amounts of these later phase movies.Yes, the after credit scene does also set up a future storyline. As do literally every other Marvel movie. I'm not really sure why the complaints are what they are from critics, considering it's how every Marvel movie is handled.Lastly, going back to the beginning. The intro credits reminded me of some of the older super hero movies. Kind of a Rami's Spiderman/Hulk/ Incredible Hulk mixture. It was the one thing that did feel less MCU like, but I liked it.

I may be overrating this because I'm a big marvel fan, but I thoroughly enjoyed this. Also saw it in a theater with a friend which made it better. One of my complaints however is how they handled Taskmaster. I would've preferred they stuck to the comics and made her look cooler (like the comics) and didn't go for the gender swap twist.

But a few days ago I rewatched all the MCU films in chronological order, so I have them fairly fresh in my memory. All of them have their ups and downs, but for me the key is their entertainment factor, combining the superhero lore with some deep emotional moments and also some good comedic bits. On that base, my favourite installments are Guardians of The Galaxy, Thor Ragnarok, Avengers: Infinity War and Avengers: Endgame.That being said, I can't see the appeal that many people see in Black Widow. I guess it's a matter of personal expectations and I guess I was expecting something darker, stronger, more tormented, that would get into the skin of the character, which, admittely, is not one of my favourites of the MCU. Not having read the comics that inspired them, and judging solely from the movies, BW is quite limited to be the pretty, sexy, if cold, female presence. She has no super powers that we are aware of, other than her undeniable beauty (although sometimes she seems to have a disproportionate strength for her size) and an amazing capacity to calm the Hulk. A lot of cartwheeling and pouting, but little else. I wonder how popular the character would be, if it wasn't portrayed by the amazing Scarlett Johansson.If, like me, you want to know more about Nat's life before the Avengers, you won't find much in this film. We get to know little about her past, through glimpses about her indoctrination as a Russian \u00bfspy?, Red Sparrow style, which is mostly told and not showed. The movie focuses more in the dynamics of her stranged and bizarre family, but this is also showed passingly. We don't get to see how she grew up or how she turned up to be so skilled and lethal.I was also expecting to know more about her relationship with Hawkeye and what transpired in Budapest, but I guess we will never know.And then there is Florence Pugh, an overrated actress, if you ask me. She is not, by no means, a bad actress, but she is certainly no Meryl Streep. I don't understand all the praise she is getting.Her character in BW has the spotlight because that's Disney's marketing choice, but it is underdeveloped. We don't know anything about her or her motivations, other than \"I want to save the rest of the BW\". For someone who has spend almost all of her life under a rigorous and cruel training and indoctrination, she seems quite childish and immature. And of course, there's no hint of the seductive skills attributed to a female Russian spy, because, you know, this is Disney.Scarlett, by the way, seems to be bored and tired of her character and there are some scenes when she seems to be on autopilot. It is barely noticeable, though, since she is such a great actress, altough this kind of films are clearly not the vehicle to highlight her acting chops.As for action lovers, there are a couple of motorcycle chases and some fights, but don't expect to be surprised or amazed by any of them. There are some implausible scenes that require an absolute suspension of disbelief and that, frankly, look quite ridiculous.In short, I wasn't moved or shocked, there are no strong emotional moments or powerful scenes to remember, no shocking revelations or game-changing discoveries regarding the character. I still feel like BW owes her fan love and adoration only to Scarlett Johansson and this film has done nothing to change that perception.Special mention for the debatable casting choices (in spoiler)SpoilerThe villain, really? Don't get me wrong, Ray Winstone is a wonderful actor, but his days of inspiring fear are gone. You will expect someone who elicits a sense of inminent danger and evil or, at least, someone with surprise/ novelty value, as the previous MCU films had (Mads Mikkelsen, Josh Brolin, Tom Hiddleston, Andy Serkis, Jake Gyllenhaal , Hugo Weaving, Cate Blanchett, to name a few).David Harbour as comic relief becomes annoying after 5 minutes and Rachel Weisz looks sleep deprived. The Russian accents are caricature level.And I don't even want to start with Taskmaster, but I'll just say that Olga Kurylenko has finally found a role that suits her acting skills.In another note, what's with all the shots of SJ's rear end, for no apparent purpose? I get it, she's hot, but it feels like a poor stylistic resource. Thank God BW is directed by a woman ..."}, {"reviewer_name": "aleksanderk-95350", "date": "15 July 2021", "text": "This film feels forced doesn't need to exist. I still found it enjoyable.

The action scenes were good but in my opinion there was too many of them and some of them were pointless and kinda predictable.

When watching a movie you can sometimes tell how it's going to play out, the MCU trope is definitely the one you can see in a mile away, but it works when they have a good story and Black Widow doesn't have one. Especially when the characters they give you, you don't care about. There's so many flaws in the movie, and it's surprising that they still greenlit this one. It's more of a fan service but other than that the film is whatever. The villain is surprisingly bad and the way they tried to make the character connect within the story is just lazy writing. There goes a villain, Taskmaster, that I was anticipating to see just turn to a lame sheet paper written character right next to other villains that MCU didn't do justice.Throughout the film you get a bit of both, which some might call it story and action, but it's layered with bad pacing and editing to which you don't care much of what is happening. There's a point in the movie that the filmmakers try to give you a glimpse of the \"family reunion\" by doing a catch up, and making you understand more so of WHO these characters are. Trying to give you emotional feeling but it sure does go on for a little too long which makes the scene overwhelming.Finally, some of the action sequences are too wonky, which is mainly the editing that makes it feel out of place. Although, there's a specific scene that I enjoyed was when Black Widow and Taskmaster first fought, which is surprisingly baffling that they gave you these other action sequences that are too crappy.The \"best\" part is the after credits, which showcase what's going to happen in the following MCU story giving it a full circle.

She was given a good background, and she has the most hilarious lines in the movie. David Harbour was also great in his role, but i doubt we see more of him, unless he appears in flashbacks.The marvel movies are supposed to be fun, have epic action, with some jokes here and there,. It is all there, it is well executed.

And finished watching just to see post credit scenes.As usual Marvel always find ways to put humor in scenes, kudos to the writers.The action sequences are pretty much super heroic it would have definitely give great experiance in theater. But on OTT platform it is missing that spark.In the end it is a good bye to a great Marvel character who has shown emence potential to overcome from any situation. Without having any superpower blackwidow survived and gave great life lessons. It could have been much better send off.

This was the Marvel equivalent of The Rise Of Skywalker- large buildup, excitement in the fandom, and God-awful execution. The post Credits scene was the only redeeming factor of this film. Whereas people expected the cocky, taunting Taskmaster, they instead got a gender swapped buffoon pretending to be a formidable opponent. Don't get me wrong- I have no problem with the gender swapping ( I love Tilda Swindon as The Ancient One) , I only have a problem when it fails to fulfill hype, or a storyline. To be blunt, I honestly was more pleased with the Taskmaster from the Marvel's Avengers Video Game.Now, this is a SPOILER\nI do love the fact that they integrated Clint Barton. I look forward to this fight in the upcoming Hawkeye series.OVERALL\nI was fairly disappointed by this film.

As the days got near,I realised that due to the screening time,I would miss seeing the England V Denmark match at the 2020 Euro's!Having paid for the ticket ages ago,and interested in opening this new chapter of the MCU, I crossed my fingers that England would win, (well done lads!) and got set to at last met the widow.View on the film:Waiting in the wings since her head-turning entrance in Iron Man 2 (2010-also reviewed), Scarlett Johansson visibly displays delight in finally presenting Black Widow in her own solo film, with Johansson firing the MCU quips and performing the action scenes with a live-wire enthusiastic edge, which Johansson dual-welds with fractured emotions from the traumatic experience of the Red Room where she was forced to become a spy/assassin,and the lingering horror from seeing her family torn apart.Whilst Ray Winstone brings unintended (?) Comedy into proceedings thanks to his boo-hiss Russian baddie coming from the Sean Connery School of Accents, David Harbour soars like a Rocketeer as he spreads one-liners across the sky. Squeezing into the dusty, disused for 20 years costume of the Red Guardian, Harbour unleashes the comedy with a gruff warmth becoming revealed in the family reunion.Loaded with the same assassin skills as her sister, Florence Pugh makes Yelena stand out by hitting the physical comedy with a real glee that gently mocks the action moves of her sister, whilst at the same time, Pugh brings out a vulnerability to Yelena's fear of losing her family whilst inside the Red Room.Showing Black Widow at the beginning watching the 007 flick Moonraker on TV, (both have a sky diving sequence, and their baddies share a lair which hovers above Earth) director Cate Shortland & cinematographer Gabriel Beristain hint about what they later unleash in the explosive final set-pieces, which crunches long panning shots spinning along the shiny CGI of the Sci-Fi Red Room,with Spy thrills of brutal hand to hand combat sequences between Black Widow and silent assassin Taskmaster.Reuniting them after two decades apart, Shortland wonderfully captures the fragile re-building of the family bond with long wide-shots sitting in on Black Widow round the family table healing wounds that have been left open for years.An executive producer on the film, Johansson revealed that she wanted the movie \"To comment on... this incredible movement of women supporting other women, and coming through these shared experiences of trauma on the other side by really coming forward and supporting one another.\"Whilst featuring a killer post-credit twist that links to the MCU, the screenplay by Eric Pearson, Jac Schaeffer and Ned Benson place the emphasis on Black Widow heroically fighting through her experiences of trauma from when the opportunity to choose was destroyed in childhood, via now battling to support other women who have been traumatized in the Red Room, and with family by her side, Black Widow fights tooth and nail, in order to give other women the chance of a free choice."}, {"reviewer_name": "atjoseph", "date": "10 July 2021", "text": "I loved every minute of this movie the jokes loved ylenna she was amazing.

But unfortunately this film just doesn't do the character justice, especially as a send off for her.The film is best described in one word \"Meh\". At no point did I really feel invested in this movie, and that mainly felt due to it being a prequel, so you knew she was in no danger at any time, even when she is the room with all the other widows near the end.The film tries to be smarter than it is and emulate the winter soldier, which is admirable, but doesn't come close unfortunately. There are far to many unanswered questions in the film too - for example, the plot revolves around widows who, in response to Natasha leaving the organization of her own free will, are now being mind controlled but a drug, including Natasha's \"sister\" Yelena, who manages to be injected with the antidote and thus tries to bring down the Red room with Natasha, whilst being chased down by Taskmaster...Who developed the antidote? Don't knowWho gave it to the black widow who dies at the start? No idea.Why did Yelena send Natasha clues to meet up, only to try and kill her when she meets her at the safehouse? Who knows?Why is Taskmaster.... well why is Taskmaster! I'll come to that shortly...The supporting cast of characters are okay, Yelena is a good character and played well, and there are some good scenes between the two, the Red Guardian unfortunately starts off well enough in the flashback scene at the start of the film, however once we cut to present day he is played as the idiot comedy relief for the rest of the film. I won't try and turn this in to a sexist debate, but the film has about 3 males in it, and none of them are really portrayed well, and Mileena is just there really, she has no character development and is shown to be a fairly evil woman who has developed the mind control drug, tortures animals at her own farm, yet get no comeuppance in the movie. Other than Yelena I can't say I really warmed to any of the others.Now, on to the villans....Dreykov - the big bad russian boss of the red room. Who should play such a role that would require a strong russian accent? Who better than Ray Winstone.... Now, I'm not saying he's a bad actor, but the only accents I feel he can comfortably pull off are \"cockney\", and \"cockney\". Whilst he does have screen presence, his scenes were just painful to watch as he had such a bad accent you couldn't take him seriously! The character is barely onscreen so you get no real idea of his threat level and why he is such a bad man, which in fairness is well pointed out by Natasha during their scenes at the end, however the fact that he has somehow got some pheromones that stop the widows attacking him is ridiculous - step back a few metres and shoot the guy!And now we come to (Sigh) Taskmaster... one of the most anticipated villains in the Marvel catalogue - Antony Masters, a mercenary who possesses photographic reflexes and that allow him to mimic any fighting style and has bested many of Marvel's best - nope! Not this one! This one is no other than a mind controlled woman. Given the obvious reveal of who this is, this wouldn't be so bad if they had actually used a female stunt woman for the him instead of clearly having a man do all the scenes! I don't know if this was done to throw people off for the reveal or not, but it was so infuriating! I was really looking forward to seeing how Natasha would use her skills to beat \"him\" in the end and was ultimately massively disappointed.Overall I feel this film was a story that just didn't need telling - aside from Yelena none of the characters in the film will be seen again in the MCU, and no one will care about that either. I for one would have much rather have seen an origin story about how Black Widow and Hawkeye and how he was sent to kill her but changed his mind and ultimately convinced her to switch allegiances, and explored the Budapest reference."}, {"reviewer_name": "stephanierie", "date": "19 July 2021", "text": "I think the movie is just another example of \"wasted opportunity\" for a character who has been of great importance in the now concluded Infinity Saga. Boring, predictable, bad script and bad CGI, absurd scenes for a \"not enhanced character\", and useless banter every few minutes. Scarlett has done better as Nat in the past. Yelena/Pugh is annoying most of the time. The character of Harbour is the most embarrassing and useless in the movie and together with Rachel Weisz they are the top one useless duo in the story. Their fake russian accent is ridiculous and their roles in the end are not even necessary. The role of the Taskmaster has been completely changed without reason. The cringe is a serious problem for 3/4 of the movie. The dialogues are not interesting, there is a very high risk of making the viewer fall asleep during more than one occasion (it happened to me). As a big marvel fan I can say that I am disappointed with this product, definitely not what I would have expected after all the waiting. Underwhelming and over the top at the same time, too long and boring, the inconsistency of many scenes, put there for the solely purpose of filling the cosmic void of an hopeless screenplay, is a great disappointment.

Liked the more griddy style of the movie that is set up right at the opening credits and keeps pretty steady throughout the runtime.

The beginning and second half of the movie offered up a nice creative, refreshing introduction and building action climax that basically hit the right buttons. Some audience members may have appreciated a little better plot development in the beginning as scenes rapidly proceeded apace with the mental catch-up game for some people trying to figure out what was happening even as the opening sequences were nicely done as the action became quite compelling and original without super-hyper drive special effects. The movie then however became a little stilted with the hyper-action that seemed overdone and quite derivative using many action sequences done before in many movies. Yet the screenwriters, directors, and actors redeem themselves well with a powerful second half of the movie with nice double twists, humor, and emotionally touching interludes as a family or what might be called a family.

Basically, in 1995, young Natasha Romanoff (Ever Anderson) and Yelena Belova (Violet McGraw) were raised in Ohio by surrogate parents, Russian undercover agents, super-soldier Alexei Shostakov (David Harbour), aka the Red Guardian, Russia's Captain America, and Black Widow Melina Vostokoff (Rachel Weisz). The family are forced to escape to Cuba, General Dreykov (Ray Winstone) takes Romanoff and Belova to the Red Room for training. Years later, Shostakov is imprisoned in Russia, while Romanoff (Scarlett Johansson) defects to S. H. I. E. L. D. after bombing Dreykov's Budapest office, apparently killing him and his young daughter Antonia (Ryan Kiera Armstrong). In 2016, after the Avengers have parted ways (Civil War), Romanoff is a fugitive, escaped from U. S. Secretary of State Thaddeus Ross (William Hurt) and flees to a safehouse in Norway supplied by Rick Mason (O-T Fagbenle). Meanwhile, Belova (Florence Pugh) kills a rogue former Black Widow but encounters a synthetic gas called Red Dust that neutralises control of her mind. Belova sends the antidote to Romanoff hoping that she will return to help her free the other Widows. Romanoff unknowingly drives off with Red Dust, she is attacked by deadly masked agent Taskmaster (Olga Kurylenko) who wants the antidote. After evading Taskmaster, she realises that the antidote came from Belova. The two reunite in Budapest, where they are attacked by mind-controlled Black Widows. While escaping, Romanoff learns Dreykov is alive, and the Red Room is still active. Romanoff was haunted by the memory of detonating the building with young Antonia inside whilst targeting Dreykov. Romanoff and Belova evade Taskmaster and meet back up with Mason who supplies them with a helicopter. Romanoff and Belova break Shostakov out of prison to learn where Dreykov is, and he tells them that they need to speak to Vostokoff. On a farm outside Saint Petersburg, Vostokoff has experimenting with chemical mind control on pigs. There, Belova reveals that while they were not a real family, she believed they were so. Vostokoff admits she sent their location to Dreykov, and soon agents arrive and take them to the Red Room, an aerial facility. On the base, it is revealed that Vostokoff and Romanoff have switched places using face mask technology before they were captured, allowing Vostokoff to free Shostakov and Belova from their restraints. Meanwhile, Romanoff confronts Dreykov, who sees through her disguise. Romanoff learns Taskmaster is Antonia, who survived the explosion but suffered severe damage. Dreykov implanted a chip in her head, turning her into the perfect soldier, capable of mimicking the actions of anyone she sees, including several Avengers. Romanoff attempts to kill Dreykov but fails to harm him due to a pheromone lock installed in her and every Widow. Dreykov reveals that he controls Widows worldwide via his desk console. Romanoff intentionally breaks her nose, severing her nasal passage to avoid the pheromone, and then attacks Dreykov. Shostakov battles Taskmaster, while Vostokoff destroys one of the facility's engines, and Belova searches for the other Widows, who are controlled to protect Dreykov. Together, Shostakov and Belova lock Taskmaster in a cell. Dreykov escapes as the Widows attack Romanoff, but Belova explodes an antidote bomb that releases all the Widows from mind control. Romanoff gets into the control desk and copies the locations of the other Widows around the world as the facility begins to explode and fall. Romanoff retrieves the two surviving vials of the Red Dust and frees Taskmaster from the locked cell. Vostokoff and Shostakov escape in a plane just as Belova takes out Dreykov's helicopter, killing him. Romanoff gives Belova a parachute before battling Taskmaster in freefall. After landing, Romanoff uses the antidote on Taskmaster, freeing her from servitude. The freed Widows arrive as Belova, Vostokoff, and Shostakov say goodbye to Romanoff. She gives Belova the last antidote vial and the portable drive, telling her to free all other still mind-controlled Widows. As they leave with Antonia, Romanoff awaits Ross and his men, who have arrived to apprehend her. Two weeks later, Romanoff reunites with Mason, who supplies her with a Quinjet; she intends to free the imprisoned Avengers. In a scene set after Romanoff's death, Belova meets Contessa Valentina Allegra de Fontaine (Julia Louis-Dreyfus) at Romanoff's grave. De Fontaine assigns Clint Barton aka Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner), whom she claims is responsible for Romanoff's death, as Belova's next target. Also starring Liani Samuel as Lerato and Michelle Lee as Oksana. Johansson carries the film as the superspy, Pugh is a welcome new addition as the no-nonsense assassin with deadpan putdowns, boorish Harbour and mysterious Weisz offer great support, and Winstone is a little pantomime but not a bad villain. This answers the question from Avengers Assemble about the infamous Budapest mission, it a good story with spies and mind-control, with a witty script, there are plenty of fantastic special effects-ladened chase and fight sequences to feast your eyes on, and it leaves room for emotional and funny moments (mocking the \"pose\" is a great in-joke) as well, a terrific superhero fantasy action.

Furthermore, Drakov was boring and not threatening at all. Red Guardian and Yelena Belova were great additions however.

And, I like Scarlett Johansen as an actress. While Black Widow is by no means my favorite character, I was looking forward to a well produced MCU movie (vs the TV series nonsense).It's a good thing Black Widow isn't my favorite character because this movie wasn't really about her. This movie seemed to be all about her sister who is played by. Florence Pugh and WOW does she do an awesome job at the role. Scarlett Johansen does a good job but whoever was writing the movie seemed to forget about the title being named after her. It seems as-if they are pushing to introduce Pugh as a new superhero and forgot about Black Widow in the making.So, if you tuned in for a Black Widow movie, you'll be disappointed because this really isn't it. You don't really discover anything about Black Widow then you really knew before. For that reason this one kind of confused me and resulted in a lower rating. Had the title been 'Yelena' it would probably rank up another star. David Harbor's character was pointless and a waste of dialogue. But, he got to play the Communist he's always wanted to be!Aside from the above, it was a decently produced movie. Directing was good. Acting was good. Story writing was MEH. First half of the movie is great! Second half feels like it was written by someone else and drags on then goes into easy explanations. All in all, a good movie that could have been great with a better conclusion and someone deciding who the movie was really about and sticking to it."}, {"reviewer_name": "haydenluz", "date": "14 July 2021", "text": "After over a year of waiting, Black Widow was finally released, and let's just say, it did it's job, but there was so much more to be said. Cate Shortland did a good job on clarifying events and ideas from the prior MCU films, while also doing a decent job on elaborating on a fan favorite character like Natasha Romanoff, but she definitely could've fleshed out the plot a lot more, making this film feel a little bit like a filler/setup, to the saga. With the events Shortland was telling, I feel as if this film was released a few years ago, it would've been more hard-hitting, and relevant, more than feeling a little redundant with not a lot of consequences. Black Widow had a pretty solid pace, up until the second act, where it seemed to slow down, and really drag out that two hour and fifteen minute runtime.The protagonists are what really carried this film to be as good as it is, having wonderful performances across the board, from Scarlett Johansson, Florence Pugh, Rachel Weisz, and David Harbour. Everyone was balanced well, and had really good chemistry together, especially Johansson and Pugh. My biggest issue with the film, is how they handled the Black Widow character. Yes, we received some decent input on her character, but she didn't really do too much, reminding me a lot of Prince T'Challa, from Black Panther. Another issue I had, was that they didn't make a strong, present villain. Shortland decided to make the villain more of a \"talked about threat\" (if you will), falling into the trap a lot of the MCU films have, and that's not having a strong villain.The action in the film is a mixed bag. There were some scenes that worked for me, being very entertaining to watch, but there was a surplus of action that was butchered up in the editing room, and gave it a silly, video game feel.Overall, I would definitely see this film at least once, because of the importance it has to the saga, but this falls in line with the middle of the pack films for the MCU Saga."}, {"reviewer_name": "AbyBerry", "date": "13 July 2021", "text": "I enjoyed it, specially the first half, but just as an average movie, not as a Marvel's superhero movie."}, {"reviewer_name": "nlgthunder", "date": "11 July 2021", "text": "I am really surprised by all of the negative reviews. A case of too much hype? Regardless, I hardly think this movie deserves to be torn apart.The action sequences in this film were intricate and awesome. I do wish that they would've toned it down a little. Since Natasha doesn't have super powers, some of it was pretty unbelievable that she could get up again. But I had a lot of fun during the action scenes.I loved the cinematography and production. The cast also did a great job, Pugh was pretty standout. But Scarlet did a great job playing a more vulnerable version of Natasha. She's on the run away from her Avenger family and back facing the man who ruined her entire life. She's not smug or putting on a show for Tony and the gang. I thought she was excellent.I will agree with some complaints that the villain aspect of this could've been stronger. It did sometimes feel like they were fighting a ghost due to the lack of scenes he was physically in.Overall I think the over-hype has sadly been this film's enemy.

Definitely worth to watch in the cinema!First, let's talk about the opening credits, the song, and the flashbacks from the red room were fire, it gave me chills.Next, the action scenes, one of the bests of all MCU.Also Scarlett and Florence's connection in the movie, one of the best I've ever seen, they looked like they had met 10 years ago, just like the others. Scarlett never stops surprising with her amazing acting skills, but Florence carried her character like no one else, it so fun and amazing to watch her play Yelena.The taskmaster story was not so developed but it made sense.I also liked the fact that they talked about important matters such as human tracking, and women not having a choice on having kids or not.Last but not least, the extra scene, I do have to admit it gave me tears, but it was good to somehow close her story, and move Yelena deeper into the MCU.It was great to see Scarlett Johansson play Natasha Romanoff one more time!"}, {"reviewer_name": "the_real_smile", "date": "11 July 2021", "text": "This movie is another comic made into a movie, this time Black Widow, and as the movies there is no explanation of the story, you just have to guess what's going on.

The Black Widow does not comply to this organization anymore and goes her own way, to even bring down that organization. The action, acting, directing, not top notch, but mediocre-good. Compared to the last chick flick, Wonder Woman 1984, this movie is a lot better, but still a struggle to get trough. The first half of the movie there is an overload of action scenes, but they are all the same, women who roll around the neck of an opponent to work them down to the floor, over and over again, like it's the only move they have ever learned. Then there is a homecoming scene that goes on for ever and ever, so boring. And then off course the boss level end-scene.

Turns out, hardcore Marvel fans are super disappointed with it but I haven't read any of the original storylines, so I don't care. And if you're like me, you'll also enjoy this movie as long as you give it the cinematic liberty that every Marvel movie needs. The action was epic in the first half of the movie, think Jason Bourne. The OST was good.That said, the plot...you can tell that this was written because people wanted it, because Marvel/Disney could make more money off of it. I so wish it had released after Civil War, the impact of the events of Infinity War/End Game would have been very different. I don't think the plot does justice to any of the other characters, so that was a let down, the good ones and the bad.Natasha Romanoff isn't spoken about enough, an earlier release might have done some justice, especially to Scarlett. She's usually in the conversation for her looks first and then everything else, when she's actually a badass and deserves more props. Better late than never, I guess.Florence Pugh did a really good job as well. Her work in \"Fighting with my family\" was really good too, check it out if you haven't.

Should've come out after Civil War. Rachel's accent comes out when she hunches in the movie.Review:\nAfter a year of half-cooked, mediocre releases. This movie was honestly refreshing.I have been an avid comic reader since the nineties. I have had my share of grievances with MCU but compared to DC much less. Such as there are no mutants, no WonderMan and quicksilver died too soon, No Reed Richards, no magneto. And MCU ruined A. I. M and Mandarin in a single movie.But I digress. Great movie all around. As a comic reader i always wanted and wondered what Heli jumps and Widows signature free running would look in live-action. Amazing. Not disappointed at all. But is it worth a re-watch? Maybe. Its not groundbreaking in any shape or form.Free of any brow-beating 'Hollywood Representation agenda'.After Thoughts :\nTaskmaster is an AWOL shield agent in the comics. The entire shtick of Taskmaster is that he is a freelance trainer of goons for underground organizations. He learns from superheroes and teaches it to goons. For cold hard cash. Shield lets him do it so they can keep tabs on how much the underground knows.3 users voted down my post when I had only put the disclaimer \"review coming tomorrow\".

Rumors say that feige was interested but Disney didn't give approval. Some say that it developed after wonder woman's success. We got it but unfortunately our lead is dead in the main timeline. Last year, it was one of my most anticipated films. But slowly, I started feeling that MCU won't be great like before after endgame and black widow proves it right.These are the drawbacks of black widow\n1. Timeline: This film would have some impact if it was released after civil war and the post credit scene shown in it could have been added in endgame.2. Taskmaster: taskmaster is heard to be an iconic marvel villain who can easily copy anyone's fighting skills. Taskmaster's addition in black widow made us excited but it turns into a sore thumb like Mandarin in iron man 3 and nick fury's eye in captain marvel. A twist is revealed in order to evoke some sympathy like winter soldier but unlike bucky who we knew very well in first avenger, and due to that we sympathised with him. On the other hand, we don't know anything much about the taskmaster character in order to sympathise with her.3. Villain: Its obvious that mcu lacks strong villains and black widow continues that tradition.4. Main character: we have seen in some films were the supporting characters score over the main character and save the film. It happens either because of the actor's limitations or the character. Here natasha romanoff was overshadowed by her sister Yelena belova not just in acting but also in saving the day. Scarlett Johansson is a great actress but her character is boring. No wonder she wasn't given a solo film before.5. Action sequences: Why, i was previously anticipating for black widow was because i expected it to have brilliant hand to hand combat mcu film after winter soldier. But black widow doesn't have any great or memorable action sequences.6. No entertainment: Black widow doesn't have any entertainment because of its dark concept. Even winter soldier and civil war had dark themes but where thrilling and entertaining but black widow lacks any thrill or entertainment.On the whole, black widow is a disappointing standalone film.

Scarlett Johansson always does a great job playing her. I love espionage films, and the fact that this seemed to be sort of a homage to gritty spy thrillers like the Jason Bourne franchise also had me interested. The MCU hasn't really done a spy movie before, although the taut political-thriller tone of \"Captain America: The Winter Soldier\" has some similarities with this film. Unfortunately, I was disappointed with the final project. The film is serviceable and certainly isn't bad, but it's far too bland and formulaic.The plot of the film centers around Natasha and her sister Yelena (a very strong Florence Pugh,) who were both brainwashed into an assassin program by Russian operatives when they were young--explained early on by an opening scene and a surprisingly quite grim (by MCU standards) opening credits montage. Natasha tries to track down their undercover \"parents\" that brought them into this world, and stop.its mastermind Dreykov and his masked henchman Taskmaster. Johansson and Pugh are always great to watch on screen, and are able to convey grit and realism as well as unique chemistry. David Harbour surprisingly steals the show during his scenes, but Rachel Weisz is sadly underutilized. The film doesn't really differentiate from the typical MCU formula--basically setting up a slightly-connected internal and external conflict culminating in a CGI-filled third-act action climax. What's unfortunate here is that the film misses a lot of opportunities to further develop Natasha as a character in contrast to what we know about her from previous MCU films. While Pugh is good, I'm not sure how much of an integral role she will end up having in the franchise going on.The film's pacing is fast and kinetic, but its story beats and plot tropes feel \"been there, done that\" enough by the standards of the superhero genre for the pacing to feel less significant to viewers than it normally would. Dreykov and Taskmaster are both very weak and underdeveloped villains. Some of the Jason Bourne-esque fight scenes are well choreographed, but the action doesn't really stand out compared to other Marvel films. While it can be mildly entertaining at times, viewers will ask what the broader point was here given the film's relatively light character development, formulaic tendencies, and stakes within the MCU. It's certainly not bad, but it definitely feels like a Phase 1 MCU movie deficient in the intertextuality and distinctness of some of the more recent Marvel adventures--and it doesn't end up doing much to further develop a post-Endgame MCU. Recommended only to die-hard Marvel fans, everyone else can wait to rent or stream it. 5/10."}, {"reviewer_name": "lbdbsw-93681", "date": "17 July 2021", "text": "I waited a while for this movie and I enjoyed it.

Giving some backstory to the character and a setting that takes place after Captain America Civil War. Before the character faces her fate. Its a in between installment which adds a few new characters additions and some exciting action sequences. I did find the plot to be weak and a underdeveloped villain.What worked? It was great to see a little backstory of Black Widow. The opening scene with Natasha and her sister being little with the family. Only to be separated. The girls are trained to be super assassins through a Russian experimental training. The film feels more like an esponiage action movie than a superhero. With skilled assassins that are controlled. Natasha and her sister goal through the movie is to go after the leader of the program to kill him. Which is also the weakest part of the movie is the plot.The action sequences are awesome. It has chases. Fighting. And aerial combat as characters are free falling and fighting at the same time. And a snow setting prison compound that has an avalanche crashing down.The cast ensemble is also good. Scarlett Johanson is great. Florence Pugh stole the spotlight playing her sister. A character who always wanted to have a normal life and a family but all is stripped away during there childhood. David Harbour and Rachel Weisz were great playing there parents.What did not work?The pacing of the film. The first hour is fast moving with chases and action set pieces back to back. After the family gets together. Things slow down and loses its steam. Until the climax comes around. The film also plays itself seriously compared to other mcu films which had the fun tone.I also found the villain Taskmaster to be underdeveloped. It gives a challenge to Natasha and her sister. As it chases them down through a tank vehicle or when he is on foot. It mimicks there combat style. Very brief story goes behind Taskmaster. That character just feels like it is there to give reason behind all the action. Dreykov played by Ray Winstone who is another bad guy behind the red room experiment is kind of tedious as the villain.Overall, Black Widow is a fair entry in the mcu. It has great action sequences but slow moving direction and a forgotten villain that may bring down the film. Florence Pugh and other characters are fun additions.There is one post credit scene that is worth staying."}, {"reviewer_name": "steveneli", "date": "9 July 2021", "text": "I should start by saying \"Captain America: The Winter Soldier\" is my favorite MCU film and maybe that's why I enjoyed \"Black Widow\" so much. It very much has a \"Winter Soldier\" vibe to it and gives a political thriller type origin story for Natasha. The entire cast gives a great performance and the film gives us some of the best action scenes in the MCU to date. Towards the third act it becomes less Natasha's story and more setting up the possible future Black Widow character arc. It's a stand alone film that doesn't provide a huge amount of fan service like previous MCU films. I personally would have liked to see more flashbacks about Budapest or more storytelling connecting the Black Widow and Winter Soldier programs. The film succeeds without diving too much into either besides short mentions. My only complaint is the use of Taskmaster feels like the use of The Mandarin in Iron Man 3. Taskmaster is an iconic comic book character that deserves better and I hope Marvel better uses the character in future installments. It be very easy for someone else to get their hands on the suit and redeem the character. It's a great film and the post credit scene sets us up nicely for the upcoming Hawkeye series.

Maybe not as masterful as Winter Soldier, but the vibe of it, and that it would have top 12 MCU movie potential. However, that was definitely not the case. It's called \"Black Widow\" and meant to be a send off for Scar Jo as Nat, but it instead feels more so like an introduction for Florence as Yelena (who was the bright spot of this movie for me along with Red Guardian to a lesser extent). The battles I found underwhelming for the most part, the pacing was inconsistent, and the plot wasn't all that great to me.Finally, the biggest catastrophe of this movie, \"Taskmaster\". I put quotations because I refuse to believe this is THE Taskmaster, and that it's simply some person under the name since they mentioned \"Taskmaster protocol\". It's not even the fact they gender swapped Taskmaster (although I'm not the biggest fan of that either, especially after finding out the stunt double was a man so what was the point?) but I find \"Taskmaster\" very poorly written. The abilities didn't even come naturally, it was more so driven by technology via the visor/chip as opposed to photographic reflexes. With how different the character felt, they would've been better off just making an original character as opposed to changing so much of his core characteristics in source material. I'm going to hold out hope this is another Mandarin situation where they introduce a REAL Taskmaster down the road.All in all, very average Marvel movie, and honestly probably a bit below average.

On top of it, my mum's commentaries, with whom I went to watch the movie, were hilarious in their dislike. The random text that would appear as a name of an old airline written on the helicopter, the actors' attempts at speaking Russian which neither of us could understand; the translation was obviously done directly from English without a consultation with a linguist or a Russian native, which, they could have perfectly hired for max. 500 dollars or less to check. The cold-demeanour of \"Russians\", the world renown stereotypes about Russia were all there throughout the movie. All of which made the movie cringe-worthy.It's not a secret that Russia and the US don't get along, but it would've been lovely to see a good collaboration between Russians and Americans, to correct everything that had to do with the language and show a good representation. Shame Marvel didn't bother with that.As most keep mentioning, Taskmaster who is a great villain with a solid backstory, was pushed behind the stage curtains and was made into an uninteresting, worthless character, for those who don't have the knowledge a Marvel fan does. It somewhat ruined future anticipation to see the character back again in the films.On a positive note, the post-credit scene with Valentina and Yelena, set a great action in motion for the upcoming films. As for Florence Pugh, whose roles in Lady Macbeth and Midsommar was extremely well played, it was great to see her fit into the role of Yelena so much. It will be exciting to see her again.Having said this, Natasha Romanoff is a character I love and as much as I loved to see her own movie, it likely is one of the worst of Marvel."}, {"reviewer_name": "karthic4040", "date": "9 July 2021", "text": "I love the way its all connecting..

I was pretty much looking forward to the movie, perhaps because I had incorrectly assumed it to be the origin story of Black Widow, and it seemed to be an interesting premise, since we only ever get hints of where she came from in the previous entries. The result is a bland movie, a disappointing movie with a plot that has zero stakes, random characters, and ultimately just feels like a set-up, instead of a full-fledged story.The first problem I have is the plot. It's set between \"Civil War\" and \"Infinity War\". We know what happens to Natasha Romanoff during these two movies, and I don't recall Romanoff mentioning the events that happened in this movie in \"Infinity War\". This essentially makes the plot of \"Black Widow\" feel like what you may call as a sidequest in a video game, it's highly filler and to be honest, it doesn't even feel like Romanoff is the main character here since I don't think she experiences particularly life-changing here. The main focus seems to revolve around Florence Pugh's character Yelena Belova, who plays Romanoff's sister, sort of. In the comics, Belova also assumes the mantle of Black Widow, so given that Romanoff's character died in \"Endgame\", you can guess what the purpose of the movie is.What else drives the plot? The villain. After a string of top-tier villains such as Thanos, Hela, Mysterio, \"Black Widow\"'s main antagonist represents a terrible regression. It's an amalgamation of the MCU's worst villains, reminiscent of Malekith. Bland, boring, no charisma, no presence, generic, and pretty low IQ. There's the Taskmaster, essentially a person in a suit of armor that's not even that advanced, and another villain, who's supposed to be this elusive mastermind who hides behind the curtains, but turns out to be pretty lackluster. Considering that by this time frame, Romanoff's faced and lived through the likes of Loki, Ultron, witnessed aliens and the might of superheroes like Thor, Vision, it's hard to believe that the Taskmaster will pose a threat to Romanoff.There are some side characters here. I was interested in David Harbour's character, Red Guardian, who was supposedly the Soviet counterpart of Captain America. But he turned out to be insignificant in the movie, and did not particularly stand out, which is pretty disappointing since he's supposed to be a super-soldier, yet seems incompetent throughout the whole movie. Rachel Weisz's character is also pretty generic, rounding out a roster of characters that feel uninspired, save for some flashes of charm from Florence Pugh.The action sequences were also pretty subpar. The scenes in the first half of the movie were decent, as they didn't rely too much on explosive special effects that filled the whole screen, so I got the impression that it was pursuing the style of \"Captain America: The Winter Soldier\". However, that gradually changed and the climax was a ridiculous action sequence, which while large-scale, did not really leave an impression on me.This is a pretty disappointing entry in the MCU, considering that the last string of movies they churned out, while they may be formulaic, were solid. \"Black Widow\" stumbles pretty heavily. I could respect it more if they stumbled while trying to deviate from the formula and create something quite different, but I felt this was a pretty lazily crafted movie, that only served as set-up for perhaps the growing MCU. It doesn't really provide anything new and by the end of it, you don't get the feeling that you're able to connect more dots across the different movies in the saga; it's essentially an unnecessary plot thread. Here's to hoping that Marvel can get back in the groove with its upcoming entries."}, {"reviewer_name": "Marci1900", "date": "12 July 2021", "text": "I would normally rate this an 8/10, but it currently being a 7/10 on IMDb after its opening weekend is absurd.

The acting is also spot on especially from new member Florence Pugh who play yelena.

This would be somewhat redeemed was she actually developed, but she is not in the slightest. I don't know why they had to make her related to Natasha. All they had to do was not make it obvious and develop the character even slightly and even than they failed to do that. This movie was really good, especially with the acting and action, but my lord Taskmaster's portrayal here was abhorrent."}, {"reviewer_name": "MovieWarfare", "date": "10 July 2021", "text": "I think Kevin Feige is an amazing producer, but I always felt it was so dumb that it took so long for Black Widow to have her film. What is more jarring that this came out after Endgame which concluded her story. Nevertheless, it is here and I was still kind of hype for it despite it all. The premise is \"Natasha Romanoff, aka Black Widow, confronts the darker parts of her ledger when a dangerous conspiracy with ties to her past arises. Pursued by a force that will stop at nothing to bring her down, Natasha must deal with her history as a spy, and the broken relationships left in her wake long before she became an Avenger\". So is this another MCU hit or a miss?Firstly, the supporting cast is all stellar. David Harbour as Red Guardian was hilarious and he was incredibly charming even if his character was kind of an ass. Rachel Weisz was also great as Melina, the fake mother of Natasha, as she gives a performance that conveys the conflict her character is going through yet also being quite lovable. Florence Pugh as Yelena, Natasha's sister, is the true stand out in this film. Her performance is so charismatic and charming while also being a proper badass. Her character has the most vulnerability compared to everyone else and Florence's shows this by really delivering on the emotional performance. She also has great chemistry with Scarlett Johansson so the interaction between Yelena and Natasha are some of the biggest highlights of Black Widow. Scarlett is also still phenomenal as Natasha and she still delivers here as well. We get to see more emotion from her character which allows Scarlett to do a lot more and shine in these scenes.The music score is composed by legendary composer Lorne Balfe and he continues to make another amazing score for Black Widow. Every action scene feels more hype whenever his score is being blasted and it's just awesome. The emotional scenes become more emotional and the tense scenes become more tense thanks to his score. I also really love the action scenes, for the most part. The hand-to-hand fights felt gritty and brutal which made it very entertaining to watch. There is also a pretty cool car chase and a fight where Black Widow has to fight countless other Red Room assassins which were very enjoyable as well.However, the story is quite a mixed bag for me thanks to how it is executed. The movie does a lot of telling of her past rather than showing which is kind of disappointing. I think seeing the red ledger stuff she did as a Red Room assassin would've given the ending more impact. Additionally, Black Widow explores the theme of family but handles it quite poorly. Natasha confronting her fake family is emotional stuff and the movie does show it but it would then deflect it with a silly joke which did get annoying. This is terrible when it came to the dad, Red Guardian. The movie treats him like a joke even though he did an incredibly terrible thing that caused his fake daughters to dislike him. There is a moment where he does start trying to repair his relationship with his daughters which was very sweet but the story doesn't stay long enough on this. He also doesn't get a moment to show how much he cares for his daughter which disappointed me. I did have my issue with how jokes are used in MCU movies but I think it is more annoying here than it is in previous MCU movies. The story is also very low stakes and because of Endgame, there doesn't feel like there is much danger to our main characters.The action scenes near the end are quite disappointing as well. There is a fight between the Red Guardian and Taskmaster which sounds on paper cool as both have some kind of superpower. However, the editing had lots of cuts with also constantly cutting away to something else which made it jarring. Additionally, Red Guardian, despite having super strength, never gets to show this in the fight. There is also a final fight between Black Widow and Taskmaster at the end which is mostly a CGI fest but is also incredibly short as well. It was a disappointing final fight for sure. On that note, the villains in Black Widow are also very disappointing. Dreykov, the leader of the Red Room, doesn't even have much of a presence on the plot until 40 minutes in. Even when they start appearing, they still have no presence as the plot is more focused on getting the family together than villains doing something. Taskmaster may be the most disappointing villain in MCU history. They are such a deviation from the comic as Taskmaster never speaks ever. There is also a reveal about Taskmaster that is just lame.Overall, Black Widow is a movie I feel so incredibly conflicted about. The story and villains are quite poor but there are moments in it that are very good. The characters and performances by actors are all great but some characters don't get enough to shine. The action scenes are entertaining but it does stumble near the end. Black Widow is a movie with a lot of good that contains some bumps throughout.

But don't let \"Family friendly\" sound cliche here. The cast cohesion was breathtaking and natural. Florence Pugh met, matched, and completed Johansson's character as well, with the entire cast giving the audience such amazing charisma, strength, and grit. Incredible choices that fully brought the film to life. There was much wonder about how Black Widow would be brought to the screen with such a dark backstory, but Director Cate Shortland and her team, brought more than the story. It is incredible how, with this film, major milestones are met in trafficking awareness, women's equality, and human kindness. Not falling short with action and cinematography, Black Widow is raw, thrilling, and inspiring, that regardless the path, regardless the person, there is always a way forward.A must-see, watch again and again, amazing action film.

She should have had the first female solo movie in the MCU, no doubt about that. No hate to Captain Marvel whatsoever, but Natasha has been an idol to so many female MCU fans long before this new modern wave of Marvel Movies. Not only that, but it's chronologically set after Civil War yet released after Endgame/Far From Home. Her character is dead and we all know it - people who don't particularly love the character, or anti-feminists, or casual Marvel fans, would most likely have little to zero interest in paying to watch a movie about a dead character.Nevertheless, the way they seemed to attempt to work around that fact is the focus on Florence Pugh's character, Yelena Belova. She's witty, snappy, uses humour as a defence mechanism but we see moments of vulnerability where she breaks down, letting the audience understand the psychological torment and familial deprivation she has gone through. It's done perfectly to contrast with the 'heart' Natasha has managed to keep - one that her undercover mother Melina Vostokoff, played by Rachel Weisz, refers to twice in the movie - clearly due to her reformed self having joined and found a family in the Avengers. The characterisation and sisterly relationship for the two Widows has been done perfectly, from the whistling at the start of the movie to the whistling in the post-credit scene at Natasha's grave.There are plenty - maybe too many - action scenes in the movie, but it doesn't take away or interrupt the flow of the plot. The pacing between action and storytelling/plot development is quite good, keeping you on your toes, making your tear up a little, pulling some laughter out of you. The CGI could have been better, but it wasn't as horrible as some people have been saying. The best part of the movie was by far the credits at the beginning. They were done so well to quickly but efficiently go through Natasha and Yelena's time in the Red Room as children. Really clever work, all down to the music choice as well.O. T. Fagbenle character, Rick Mason, was an odd choice to me. He didn't really add anything to the movie. What I seemed to understand about Rick's character is he's simply proof that Natasha has friends and is capable of holding friendships with people outside the Avengers - real friends, not just work buddies. I'm unsure where his character could go after this though. The hype with his character poster being released led to disappointment. Many theories spread, suggesting his character is likely to be Taskmaster, but the true reveal ended up being a little disappointing. However, it's important to note that this is only disappointing to Marvel Comics fans who have been excited for Taskmaster. There really is no way to go with this character anymore, and as the 'main' villain of the movie, Taskmaster had surprisingly little screen time. This issue with Taskmaster is what takes a star off this review.Red Guardian is the other star taken down. He had been turned into a joke character. I don't mind it, I found him quite funny and caring in his own way, someone lost in his glory days. His breaking out of prison scene was somewhat laughable: this super-soldier failing simple jumps, dropping because of a little electricity - we seem him casually arm wrestling and talking earlier while getting a tattoo, but he can't withstand a little shock? I'd hope we get to see him more in the future, and for his character to be taken more seriously - although I love the humour so some of it can stay - but I'm unsure how they'd do so. There were references to Captain America, Red Guardian suggesting he would have been more famous than him if he wasn't thrown in prison for years. And FATWS also tackled the hidden super-soldiers issue with Isaiah Bradley. Rumours of Captain America 4 had come out, so I wouldn't be disappointed if Red Guardian makes an appearance there.The post-credit scene was great, and thankfully it did do Natasha Romanoff justice. I'm glad we got to see her grave - although a funeral scene would be better. We rarely got to see the Avengers mourning her, but then again I guess this movie is showing her 'real' family, Yelena, mourning her. It sets up Yelena's character for the villain team Valentina Allegra de Fontaine is putting together - either Thunderbolt or Dark Avengers. Hawkeye is also revealed to be at 'fault' for Natasha's death, likely motivating Yelena to go after him. I'm unsure if we see her next in the Hawkeye show, or in Thunderbolts/Dark Avengers. But seeing her character as the villain, and ironically avenging Natasha's death just as she had mocked the Avengers for 'avenging' others, would be pretty interesting. I'd like to see Hawkeye converting her to the 'good' side though, just as he did with Natasha.Overall, I loved the movie, loved the casting, loved the way they handled and tackled the issue of wrong timing for this release. 100% watching is again and again to find more things to love :) Enjoy the movie and stay safe!"}, {"reviewer_name": "Maayani_ms", "date": "16 July 2021", "text": "This movie was fun to watch, had a great sense of humor (as expected) and gave us a lot of Black Widow's background.In my opinion the origin story is not of Natasha but of Yelena.

And 2) to set up Yelena as the next Black Widow (if they even do that).The acting was fine, the characters were meh (Yelena stole the show in my opinion, best character). But I think this movie wasn't necessary and brought nothing to the table.I don't even think this is a good send off movie for Nat? It left me just feeling empty. And I don't remember 90 percent of what Nat does in the film, and it's supposed to be a movie about HER.I don't like what they did with Taskmasker or that they made Nat and Yelena adopted sisters/sister figures (in the comics, they aren't related at all and don't see each other that way).But hey, that's my opinion.

I wonder if Marvel Studios does however. I mean we all know ScarJo was not their first choice to play the character, and she was regulated to being the only woman in the original male ensemble.She was also really the weakest of the characters, with arguably her ability to calm the Hulk being one of her stronger powers. This movie had a chance to tell her back story, but really only alluded to 3 years of it, 3 mainly unimportant years. We know more about the Winter Soldier's back story then Black Widow's.So this movie was about her former associates and Florence Pugh is by far the more interesting character with David Harbour being a distance 2nd. Rachel Weiz's character is really inconsistent, and then we have 3 or 4 really great action set pieces. Finally that leads to BW, who doesn't say a lot, doesn't do a lot except expose us to these other characters, and plays straight man for the villains and the cast.Sorry to break it to you Scarjo, but you're final starring vehicle/swansong vehicle was hijacked to set up a tv series and Pugh's future. They even added a pseudo Cap'n America character because they didn't think you alone could carry the flick. Hulk got his own movie, and half another when they changed actors. Hawkeye got his own series. You get your name at the top of a movie to play second banana. I do understand you got a bunch of cash, not as much as Downey Jr., but a nice some as a runner up trophy.

But the big thing (to me, at least) is that it doesn't really feel like a MCU movie. I know that sounds improbable when you consider the mixed bag making up the couple of dozen movies so far, but this one felt like a spy movie dark in tone which, despite a moderate amount of MCU namedropping, was more Bond/Bourne than Marvel.The story was fine, and we found out more about Natasha's origin (although we didn't learn much about Budapest). ScarJo was fine and Florence Pugh was outstanding as her \"sister\" Yelena: the chemistry between them was wonderful. Rachel Weisz, never a favourite of mine, was good, too.David Harbour as Red Guardian was merely OK, and the wonderful Ray Winstone disappointed.

Those points are all valid. The two things that bothered me most about this movie are problems that seem endemic to most modern films, especially those lead by strong female characters.The first problem for me is the most basic. One of the most basic rules of storytelling is making your protagonist likeable. Natasha gets a pass on this count only because she's already been established as a heroic figure in the Avengers story arc. Based on her portrayal here, there's very little to like. She's basically a reformed assassin who shows very little remorse, even for having murdered a little girl.She's surrounded by equally flawed characters - basically a fake family made up of Soviet spies and a bunch of assassins. The fact that they were all 'brain-washed' is a lazy way to get us over that hurdle. Maybe I'm old fashioned, but I miss the days when 'superheros' were people with heroic character who'd been gifted with extraordinary abilities or drive. Those characters are being lost in today's desire for 'anti-heroes' like Wolverine, Deadpool, and now Loki. I'm tired of it .The other current cultural flaw that infects this film is the apparent rule that any story featuring a strong female lead be populated with men who are either weak, corrupt, stupid, or all of the above. The women are universally strong, fierce, brilliant and relentless and the men are window dressing. There are only two principal male characters in the film. One is a two-dimensional misogynistic bully and the other is a muscle-bound, self-absorbed moron (whom we're somehow supposed to find likable).Again, I may be old-fashioned, but I don't think you have to paint all men as bullies or idiots in order to present women as heroic figures."}, {"reviewer_name": "adrianaacevedo-39418", "date": "10 July 2021", "text": "This is the story that we wanted.

Florence Pugh clearly is this pictures saving grace. David Harbour also has some fun scenes. But that's my point, if this movie was supposed to be a BW movie then why do the supporting cast shine brighter than the lead?Here's a better version. Act I: Natasha on the run from General Ross. Only to be caught and tortured by Taskmaster, unlocking flashbacks for the audience of the red room and with a younger Yelena while they grow up. Cut to present, she wakes to find present day Yelena also bound with her & they get to share earned dialogue. Enter Ross and Co. Inadvertently letting Natasha & Yelena escape, now reunited to find the Red Room and dismantle it once and for all. Act II: flashback of Budapest with Hawkeye and Natasha. Good for a 10 minute action piece, SHOWING what happened there and concluding with the death of Dreykov. Cut to present; Yelena & Natasha search for and find Melina, only to be thwarted by Red Guardian who is protecting her and her work. Fight concludes with the sisters on top; this is the part where family exposition and family flashbacks are mildly welcome. Enter Taskmaster with bad widows beating down the door, Red Guardian stays behind to fight them off and off go Yelena, Natasha & Melina on their way to the red room. Throw a little more Ross in here for flavor, perhaps sharing an ADR dialogue with War Machine/Don Cheadle (who is against all odds forcefully working for Ross) to possibly pinpoint Romanoffs next destination. Act III: finding the red room. Revealing Dreykov isn't dead, boom, now Taskmasters torture scenes feel earned as well as their existence as a character. Melina & Yelena break off to plant bombs/save the mindwashed widows; Nastasha finds Dreykov and kills him finally after a small dialogue and brief final Budapest flashback.

I first saw her in Iron Man 2, and when I saw the trailers for the first Avengers film I was so excited to finally see her in action again, and not just in one or two brief scenes. A solo film on her part, where she really is the star, finally feels like a possibility now. In fact, after seeing this trailer, I'm actually more excited for this Avengers film than I am for Infinity War.I liked Black Widow, and the fact that there's just so much space for her to work without too many constraints. You see the writing there, and you see her working without exposition or dialogue. It's all just visual. I thought it was great. 5, I think the original Silver Age - Iron Man. Here's where your list truly starts to get crazy. Marvel regularly recycles characters and concepts for their main lineup. This is something I learned a long time ago. It goes like this: Marvel and DC will generally do a \"one, two, three\" thing - DC will use a character for a period.If I were to rank Black Widow out of 10, I'd give it a solid 6.5. The movie is about her and her relationships, even if the conflict between the two is out of focus at the very start. Black Widow, the sidekick, is not an exemplar in the evolution of a hero. She was not born into the role, and her character development is not the primary focus. These days she's a strong action-movie character, and she rocks the majority of her fights.

A mix of engaging and absorbing themes, they present us with an espionage thriller driven by chemistry between the characters, the performances, the humor, the action moments, and the good visuals.The story of the movie is good, it has an approach that is refreshing to the MCU, allowing it a sense of style and fun that is really enjoyable, it doesn't try to tie in on other MCU projects to make it work. It's a solidly entertaining standalone adventure complete with fun family dynamics that adds additional character development amid all the action.The film touches on very strong themes that are still a problem in society, how they somehow absolve the arc of the protagonist in her greatest regret and we understand the actions of the red room and the psychological damage it did to Natasha. And other widows, something that stands out at this point is Taskmaster, and I'll explain why .... Taskmaster was a drone programmed by his father Draykob, the supervisor of the Red Room, a Soviet top-secret training and brainwashing program that she turned young women into the best undercover assassins in the world to execute orders with brutal efficiency. Based on what we saw in the film, we see him as a burden to the protagonists, as he remained undefeated throughout the film. And on that note, Taskmaster turned out to be too much for Natasha throughout the movie. It wasn't until climax that Natasha learned the truth, and then set out to save her. On a thematic level, this somehow absolves Natasha of her greatest regret, killing a girl to gain her own freedom, and gave her a chance to redeem herself, at least on some level, by freeing Antonia from her father's control and giving her a second chance at life like them and the other black widows.Without a doubt, this film marks a triumphant return of Marvel Studios to the cinema and we hope in the future we can continue to see these characters in the next projects of phase 4."}, {"reviewer_name": "bigdawg-17321", "date": "13 July 2021", "text": "For me personally I think it's the best marvel film to date.

I think it's very touching that she actually found someone to hold onto which is her fake sister, which also comes from the same background as her. That's how she develops this human traits that we all have which we called sympathy. The story kind of make me feel like it's very deep and emotional.

I have to say it is probably one of the top 3-4 DC movies. Of course since it is a Marvel movie, that is not a good thing. Neither is the movie and Thor:Dark World is no longer my least favorite Marvel movie. I have trusted Marvel and so far they always delivered until Black Widow. A lackluster movie was (in the words of Thanos) \"inevitable\".The story was weak. The actors did their best I felt but the story and many locations just did not support them. Taskmaster is one of my favorite villains but they really messed that up. Taskmaster was never in the \"comics\" costume with the cape and it is a shame because it is a cool costume. Also, no spoiler, this was not the comic Taskmaster in several ways.I envision a production meeting going something like \"Hey, let's make a new Batman movie. Yeah! Only instead of him being American, let's make him a Pacific Islander. Yeah! And instead of his parents being killed, he could be stranded from a boat wreck. Yeah! And instead of being rich, we make him an inner city drug dealer who then escapes prison. Yeah! That'll be an awesome Batman movie!\" Except of course it is absolutely NOT a Batman movie. I think the same thing happened here with Taskmaster and some other story elements. DC movies and Pre-Marvel Studios movies suffered from this and it is sad to see it finally hitting Marvel Studios.Red Guardian was awesome and funny and met expectations and the Yelena character was acceptable.What bothers me most of all is the people who will say \"people will not accept a female led superhero movie\" just as they did with WW84. It is not that at all (see how well Wonder Woman did). It is that people do not like a crummy movie whether it is male or female, white, black or asian led. Marvel, you can and should do better.Note that if you go see Black Widow, there is a scene at the absolute end of the credits (no other credit scenes) that sets up other things in the MCU."}, {"reviewer_name": "zacattack38", "date": "9 July 2021", "text": "I wasn't expecting much going into the movie and female-led movies have never done well.

Florence Pugh delivers a fantastic performance as Yellana, with Johannson delivering as well in the lead role. David Harbour is also a highlight playing Captain America, if he were a pathetic loser. In regards to action, this movie delivers with several exciting action sequences and fight scenes.

But like the famous quotes says : \"It isn't the destination that matters, but the journey\". Some people might not enjoy this movie in spite of that, but the truth is that it adds a lot of layers to this mysterious Black Widow Program + everything surrounding the 'Red Room' and all these dark secret projects, with everything that it impacts on a greater scale... And it obviously adds a huge deal to Natasha Romanoff's story, her life/journey, and the human being behind the Avenger... That's the purpose of a standalone MCU movie ? Yes, and it did the job well !Now, about the experience of the movie itself. The upset feelings between the main 'players' logically bring a lot of depth to the characters involved in this story, their complicated/messed-up relationships and how all these souls have been tormented since ages throughout all this dark journey they've had to endure... The movie solidifies Natasha's choices & trajectory since this dark past, while also healing many important wounds in the process (not just hers)... It adds tasty new characters and a whole new 'mythology' to the MCU, one that is grounded in a spy/secret world...The way the movie is directed and cut, cleverly resonates with the specific emotions the director wants you to feel... It is well paced and well crafted in that sense, because every scene or sequence feels and looks organic with what it's telling you, you then feel like being a part of it.The action set pieces -as always with the MCU- are high level. And as expected for a Black Widow movie, the fight scenes strike hard ! Visually, it's always very catchy, smooth and beautifully staged. You never get lost in the action because the cinematography of the whole movie is masterclass. A specific mention to the use of light and contrasts, because it just adds this delicious icing over the whole movie (certain scenes are true eye candies)... And the whole score/soundtrack must not be overlooked ; certain tracks are fantastic, powerful, epic...A very good addition to the Marvel Cinematic Universe. The movie has a lot of heart and tells a true 'self-sufficent' standalone story, while being useful to the bigger picture , it grabs you nicely from the first to the last minute and has some really strong moments.

Florence's character Yelena on the other hand actually got me cracking up at parts. Overall the acting was pretty good all round but the best acting I would say came from David Harbour & Florence Pugh(Thou I may be slightly biased here as I really like the actress xD)The storyline was honestly the weakest I've come across in a marvel movie and the villain was just boring. Like seriously it was just so boring listening to him talk or just basically any scene with the villain in it. The fake family and their drama was more entertaining to watch in all honesty. I miss when MCU villains were of the caliber of Loki, Thanos etc.All in all, I give Black Widow a 7/10. Without David Harbour and Florence Pugh I would probably rate it a 4 or 5 out of 10.I still did enjoy the film but it didn't have me wanting more with the appetite I normally have around marvel movies. One of the things I was most hyped to see in the film was what happened in Budapest between Barton and Natasha but it turns out it was just another shoot out... nothing really special really...Anyway I think the director's inexperience and lack of marvel know\nhow is what caused a lot of the problems.

I wonder if Marvel catches the real meaning: is society programmed by watching TV or social media and then acting accordingly? That is subject to individual reflection and perception.Other than that, Black Widow and cast were wasted on what could, and should, have been a tour de force rather than the intended prologue to the next Avengers team. No doubt Hawkeye will most likely meet a similar fate."}, {"reviewer_name": "Edward_Destan", "date": "11 July 2021", "text": "Black Widow new Marvel movie recounting the past of an iconic character inside the MCU.

When you take into account this is a Marvel movie and you know the characters, this becomes a disappointment. I don't want to put too much time into this review, so I'm just going to add my main issues. Spoilers ahead.1. The biggest issue in this is that they ruined Taskmaster. They turned the awesome character and origin of Anthony Masters (Taskmaster) into the story of a girl named ANTONIA who was caught in an explosion and turned into a mind controlled drone by her father. Taskmaster is now ruined in the MCU and can never join it properly unless they forget Black Widow. The only thing in this that is Taskmaster, is the name and the fact the character can mimic moves, which by itself isn't the true character.2. Apparently Black Widow is more human than other humans? I say it this way because she's constantly falling 50-100 feet and catching ledges, hitting fire escapes and hitting the ground and able to just walk away without a slight injury. I understand this is a comic book movie, but they just didn't care. Usually they go a little over the top with how much characters like Black Widow and Hawkeye can survive while keeping it somewhat close to reality. Not here. It's like the writers said, \"Okay, Black Widow can now take the same kinds of falls, hits, etc. As a super soldier, but she's human.\" and left it at that.3. Red Guardian was pretty fun, but more of a bumbling buffoon. I'm not very familiar with him or his backstory, but it was like he was in there as comic relief instead of an actual character. I can't say they ruined him because I don't know enough about him, but after his introduction I expected big things and they kind of just his wasted potential.There are more, but personally my main issue is with gender swapping Taskmaster. Unfortunately this is something that Marvel is probably going to do with a lot of characters. If you are going to make a female version of a character, at least STICK TO THE ORIGIN! Don't just create a completely new character and say that's the character now, because it's ruined. You could have literally called the character Blademaster or something and it would be a character different from Taskmaster, thus saving one of the best mercenary marvel villain's in the MCU."}, {"reviewer_name": "friendly_fen", "date": "11 July 2021", "text": "Very weak story and bad action.

Guess it never really did.BAD VFX!They either decided to lower the budget on this one, because the main character doesn't really have powers or abilities that requires much VFXs or they simply thought it wasn't worth the budget. Either way, they could've gone with physical effects on many situations like their Disney series.1 hour too long; unfunny, really boring, dry, some times cringe worthy writing.I can't say I wasn't disappointed, but also I wasn't expecting much either.WandaVision had a better story.If I could describe this movie in 3 words: filler, tedious and Irrelevant."}, {"reviewer_name": "martinyouens", "date": "10 July 2021", "text": "Started okay, after that an onslaught of bad acting, terrible jokes and terrible storyline was spewed out with a terrible pace.

If you haven't watched the movie beware I'm going to spoil it for you. Overall Black Widow was an action packed block buster that is a must see for the MCU. At the beginning of the movie this is the most tragic and sorrow filled back story that lasts about 10-20min. The middle of the film is very very slow but necessary for the plot that we knew wasn't going to be a Iron Man film that's almost all action. Some of the CGI was bad but is acceptable considering what the CGI is used for and can be looked past considering its in a few minutes of the film. As we know that the MCU is not going off comic book accuracy and shouldn't be because of how fresh their takes are in the MCU. Between the family bonding you see in the film between Red Guardian, Maria, Black widow and her little sister it makes you feel the emotion through out the film. Between the wonderful song choices and the color choices in many scenes it makes you feel connected with the movie all through out. With the gender bending of Task master and how her \"powers\" are explained is super fresh and interesting take on this comic book villain. The problems with this movie is that the tricks used are already used in multiple films with Black Widow in them, such as the face disguise as we saw in Captain America and the Winter Solider and then the electric gauntlets like in civil war, the CGI is acceptable with has obvious it was but for marvel movie it was still amazing. Another complaint of mine is that this movie is set in 2016 after Civil War but Natasha is more seasoned in combat than her appearance in Infinity war and end game. It is upsetting that Black widow is no longer in the MCU but her character was amazing in this movie.Now lets talk end credit scene, This movie is meant to be seen after civil war but has an appearance we have already seen in Falcon and the Winter solider Disney Plus series and if you haven't watched them you wont understand them. This is why I kind of have a problem with the post credit scene other than that you can see that we are going to be getting a villainy version of the Avengers in future MCU projects.Overall this movie was exciting, action packed. Cinematic master piece\n8/10 from me."}, {"reviewer_name": "jagroepjayden", "date": "10 July 2021", "text": "I have been hyped for this movie as a huge mcu fan. The movie unfortunately was underwhelming. The comedy was pretty good but the plot lacked depth. The family parts of the story were pretty good, but the main plot was kind of lacking.

It was interesting to hear her back story because up until now, oh wow, she can kick fight. What an amazing superpower. Unless you count her ability to incur deadly injury and walk it off every time. There's more to it apparently but they were very vague about it. She did a good job overall though for what it was. It looks like they set up the next Clint movie/series but I don't hold up much hope for that since his superpower is... a bow and arrow. :/ Anyway, the movie follows the same worn out plot.

Not sure which..On the face of it Black Widow is a good movie, great action sequences, enough of a story to make it mean something, a solid 6/10 if it's got a generic title, a different cast and not lifted by Marvel story from other movies that flow into this one. But it isn't that, it does benefit from the fact it is apart of the MCU as with all other movies which is why I give it a 7.However, this is a movie that is clearly 3 years too late, shoe horned in after the fact (Endgame) to supply some sort of deeper meaning to a B plot point from it and there to tie up some loose ends of previous throw away comments in Avengers Assemble.Summed up, the movie is inferior to the \"free\" content released on Disney Plus, is too little too late to add value to Natashas sacrifice in Endgame, the villain(s) join the forgettable ranks along with Yellow Jacket, Whiplash and the rest which is a shame as Taskmaster is a fairly interesting villain in the source material but just used here as fodder to the Widow programme story.It's rare I throw this much criticism at a Marvel project but defiantly holding this movie back for a cinema release when it's nearly another 6-7/10 generic Marvel piece is confusing and disappointing."}, {"reviewer_name": "mrpicky", "date": "10 July 2021", "text": "What did you expect from your basic soviet assassin comics character ?

It comes with everything you expect from any Marvel movie. A huge VFX budget, smirkable one-liners and some feel good political correctness. Woo girl power! But Black Widow does nothing to raise itself from the flock and make it alongside the greats such as Ironman, Doctor Strange or Infinity War. The cinematography is fine, the actors are fine, the issue comes with the villain. It seems like the script writers were a little too focused on women good, white man bad, that they forgot to give the villain literally any motivation at all. Just a copy paste evil man with a hidden layer and a legion of faceless goons.

First of all there aren't any good men to see here. Guys are either stupid, antagonistic or outright evil.On the other side there is the \"Sisterhood\" feeling which the movie even explicitly mentions. There were two men and around a twentysome women in the theatre. My young friend dragged me into it and I wanted her to be happy.So, there I sat and I wondered who would make such an imbalanced type of movie? Having a strange idea of genders is one thing, but it was also about character development and character interaction.Johanssons performance and storyline was fine, but that of her family far less so. There was no chemistry between the members at time although the story has a few explanations. I loved to see Rachel Weisz again, but I felt she lacked screentime. Florence Pugh is different generation and the youngest of the three. And I felt reminiscences of the usual teenage flick out there. Something I try to avoid in my spare time. It's not bad acting but I can't stand the mix of sassiness, sarcasm and negativity.The whole movie was written in James Bond style. It had it all and there was no need for having superheroes in it, with just a few adjustments to the script. It was a Bond script in disguise of a Marvel superhero movie. Let's just add that there are a only a few cross references to other Marvel content. Bond movies have the disadvantage that they are both stereotypical and predictable. Likewise we get to see expensive sets and locations. The chase gets a bit old though after a while.When it comes to style and editing, this is state of the art. It's all beautiful and well colored. But just as already stated: there are about one or two sets more than it's good.To sum it up, it was at once entertaining but it also drained my nerves to watch anything like this in the future.One last thing: in times of Covid, we're forced to wear masks.

With such a resourceful story and talented cast, so much can be done. What a waste."}, {"reviewer_name": "artemislogic", "date": "12 July 2021", "text": "Overview\nThe overall pace of the movie was good, however you need to suspend your disbelief to get through some parts, in particular the lack of logic, character development and meaningful dialogue. The lack of a moral compass, accountability, and understanding of general human behaviour and it comes across as cheap. There are also a lot of parts that just seem out of character.Performances of all the actors were great, Florence Pugh as always giving a great performance, I feel the writing lacked in a lot of areas though so well done for working with what they had but I do expect much better logic and writing for a movie set in the MCU, not the best start to Phase 4.Negatives\nChild Killing is Okay\nBlack Widow blows up a child and it's basically just brushed over and justified, then it's discovered the child survived, \"so she wasn't so bad after all\".But the moral aspect of this I have a problem with, mainly with how the present day character confronts and justifies this. It's just brushed over and they do a terrible job treating this like it's an issue that can be resolved with action (by her saving this child now she's grown up) instead of some kind of introspective character growth.They don't properly address it for what it is, sort of like that WW1985 problem, but worse because this is child killing justified by a present day avenger.Plot Armour\nThere's a lot of examples of this, but in particular the helicopter scene.Pugh's character casually aims a rocket launcher while bullets hit inches away from her to the left and right. We see bullets pierce helicopter, but it isn't shot down despite a million people are shooting at it. It's a normal helicopter acquired by some random guy, it's not made of Vibranium.This is too unrealistic and therefore hard to immerse myself in, I'd put it down to either bad directing or writing of those particular plot-armour laden scenes; you need an extreme sense of disbelief to enjoy them.As I said they're just not up to the standard I've come to expect from the MCU and I don't feel like this movie was given the respect it deserved."}, {"reviewer_name": "pardes2002", "date": "11 July 2021", "text": "I'm kinda disappointed with this movie, I love the Marvel movies and this has to be by far the worst movie of them all..

Yup that's it. Honestly, I think they wasted him. I mean such a great comic book villain just gone wasted. But is it enough to rate this movie 1 star? Hell no, sure I hate how one of the most epic villain is just mute throughout the whole film who is known for his savage dialogues, but this was Natasha's story and more or less he(she) was getting less relevant to the story maybe they should've used another villain but still it doesn't take away from your movie experience.Secondly, ya, there's an argument how everything does feel pointless cause Natasha is dead anyway. And I agree with that maybe this would've felt different if it came out just after the Civil War.Also, that pheromone thing was stupid.

It was hard for me to get into it knowing that she dies in Endgame. I wished it had been Hawkeye instead of her because she was way more interesting and I just liked her character more. The only foreseeable reason that the MCU would even make this movie would be to set up the anti-avengers which you see the clip at the end of this movie and setup the \"new black widow\" character. The relationship between Natasha and her sister was good, I felt. I chuckled at how she made fun of Nat for flipping her hair.... The Red Guardian was a bit of a let down to me. He reminded me of Mr. Incredible; fat, out of shape and just trying to reminisce about the good 'ol days. Now about the task master, That was horribly executed. The fact that it was the villains daughter.....really? When the taskmaster is fighting it's clearly a male stunt person in the suit. The actress that plays taskmaster is a fairly small woman and to me that was laughable that they would even try to pass that to the audience. Also, there is literally no build\nUp to this character..... I would have been highly upset if I would have paid money to watch this movie. IMO it's easy to forget and watching it makes me wish they had not have killed off Natasha Romanoff.

My biggest complaint is the humor. Anytime there's an emotional foothold in Black Widow, it gets cut short with a witty comment from another character, thus ruining what should be engaging. Another negative is the weak villain(s). Taskmaster is turned into a victim. If the writers weren't obligated to tell fans the long-awaited story behind Budapest, the character and story probably would've gone a different direction and for the better. The main villains motive is lazily written too. My last big complaint is the action. It's pretty lazy and unappealing for the most part. The editing in these scenes is also pretty bad. Now, onto the positives.The biggest positive is act one. The opening sequence is great attention grabber. The entirety of act one also felt more serious than an MCU movie. It was refreshing and great to experience. Another positive is Florence Pugh. I personally enjoyed her more than Scarlett. The final major positive is that it did a good job at balancing the scenes with action and without action.Overall, Black Widow is alright. It's another movie that'll get lost in the oversaturated genre of comic book movies.

Then Belova began to resent the fact that Fontaine was disturbed during her vacation. But Fontaine told her that she just wanted to say goodbye to Romanoff, Belova did not believe her, saying that she had come to give her a new mission. Fontaine confirmed this with a laugh, then Belova replied that she needed more money. Fontaine said that she also wants to, but she still said that she would get, or rather earn. Having convinced her with words that she could avenge the death of her\" sister\", she showed her the goal that needed to be eliminated. This goal was Clint Barton, whom Fonten declared the killer of Romanoff.I was touched by the scene where Natasha talks to Elena and opens her soul and says that everything was real, I even began to feel the rhythm of my heartbeat.I want to say that I can't agree with those who consider this movie tedious, long and boring, although I understand that everyone has a different subjective opinion. I'm not a big fan Marvel, but when watching this movie, 5 minutes seemed to me for 1, there were moments when Elena trolled Natasha (with funny phrases that you can laugh at) it was very good, these moments diluted the film during the battle scenes, so the film did not look boring.The villain in the film turned out to be what it should be, a passing one, but the antagonist, Taskmaster, was merged, but this could be expected, because the film is about Natasha's story, and a good antagonist would draw attention to himself.The action in the film is very good, I watched the film without complaints, the staging of the battles was not."}, {"reviewer_name": "cannibalbones", "date": "10 July 2021", "text": "I love Scarlet.I think she's a tremendously talented actress and I've been a major fan since Lost in translation, where she completely stole the scene.I liked this movie and in my opinion it's one of the better MCU movies.

It is great to finally see a stand-alone film for a character that has been on the sidelines since the beginning. The action sequences are great and there are many touching moments through the story.

The new heroes added to the MCU with this movie make me excited to see what Marvel can put out in the future. Florence Pugh's character was especially entertaining to watch in action.One very major critique of Black Widow is the movie's handling of Taskmaster. To put it frankly, she shouldn't have been Drakov's daughter. Taskmaster is an incredible villain that deserves a better backstory and motivation than mind control.This complaint can easily be forgotten when you think about the post credit scene. Contessa Valentina Allegra de Fontaine is back, and she has a new recruit. It is clear that she is forming a new squad of heroes (if you want to call them that) and it is so exciting to see what she will get up to in the next couple years.All in all, Black Widow is a great, yet not incredible superhero film.

Although it's perhaps not Scarlett's best as Natasha. Florence Pugh's performance was worth mentioning as well, she was good in this one.Unlike most of the previous Marvel films, this one doesn't reflect the serious moments with jokes the whole time, resulting in a movie with deeper characters and more emotions. That's why I consider the second act to be the best part of the movie.Well choreographed battle scenes as expected, but they can get a bit repetitive sometimes.Negatives:\nIt's no secret that Marvel movies are as popular as they are because of their entertainment value. And I thought this one lacks that, to keep it brief let's say that it had pacing issues.The MCU's villain problem continues, Taskmaster was well introduced in the first act but poorly handled throughout the rest of the film, and the plot twist sort of wasted the character for me. A very disappointing side villain. And the main villain was perhaps the worst part in the movie. Very generic and not interesting at all.The dialogue can be cheesy sometimes and filled with cliches, especially in the third act.Conclusion:\nI thought Black Widow would have served the story and the universe a lot better if it was released in 2017.

The whole cast gave awesome performances and Pugh almost stole the show. Johannsson, Pugh, Weisz, and Harbour performed really well together.The story and plot were a lot different than past Marvel films (gave me Winter Soldier vibes) and I really liked the spy/thriller feel that the movie had, which was a nice change to non-stop action. The main arc of the movie was done very well, giving extra background to BW's past and the history of the Widows, which hasn't been touched on at all. The movie and story did a great job closing out BW's arc and providing a nice bookend to her story, but leaving the Widow line open for Pugh and others to come in (fingers crossed) and pick up the snub Glocks and Widow belt.My biggest issues were the villain(s). Dreykov was the overall villain in the film, using Taskmaster (his daughter??) to do his bidding, along with the other Widows, to begin a movement to a world where free will didn't exist. To me, Taskmaster is one of the most bad a$$ villains out there in the comics. Not that I didn't like the reveal of Dreykov's daughter as TM, but she was missing and did not play as large a part in the film as I was hoping she would as Taskmaster. It was a cool arc seeing BW get closure with her there at the end, but c'mon, you cannot promise Taskmaster and only half do it.The dialogue and CGI was all great, in Marvel fashion, and this movie was definitely worth the wait.

I could easily see some people seeing/enjoying this film strictly for the well crafted fighting.While it would be easy to make a film about an aloof spy very cold and void of emotion, \"Black Widow\" carries much heart with laments on family, and how overwhelming and shocking it can be to confront ones past.

I have to admit, marvel movies just can't disappoint you. As the first film of the Fourth Stage, Black Widow retells the story of Natasha after Captain America 3, when she went on a run and obliterated the Red Room with her original \"family\". Since Natasha doesn't have superhuman abilities, the movie contains a huge amount of short-range combats and mirror-like dual that are intense to watch. Also, Natasha's family are introduced to the marvel universe, all played by skillful actor and actresses who provided the audience with laughter and resonance. The mystique of Red Room and Taskmaster is unveiled in Black Widow as well, as we get to see Natasha finally eradicating the fear of her origin. The only downsides I could think of are the heroes invincibility regarding car crashes and plane wrecks, and the confusing fragility of the antidotes. (broken by a punch yet surviving the plane crash?) If the movie would've make the widows volunteer as cold blood killers and spies instead of controlled puppets, and because of Natasha's kindness and sympathy they are salvaged, the ending would've been better.

Lorne Balfe's soundtracks lifted movie's scenes with its cold and eerily melodies.

This movie is directed by Cate Shortland. It has Scarlett Johansson as Natasha Romanoff, Florence Pugh as Yelena Belova, Rachel Weisz as Melina Vostokoff, David Harbour as Alexei Shostak, Ray Winstone as Dreykov and Olga Kurylenko as Taskmaster.The movie is a prequel to the story of Natasha Romanoff of the time between the movie Captain America: Civil War and Avengers Infinity War. The movie shows her past activities and her relation to the Red Room fellows and her \"family\"This movie is overhyped unnecessarily. An expensive homage to a character that could've been rectified in the Endgame. But they did not. This being a MCU movie will have dramatic showing of how women are underestimated and traumatized in the world. However this movie also shows the MCU definition of family where anybody could be family who is worth fighting for. The story was so predictable that what I imagined came to be true with a little very twist. The family was created for accomplishing a task and after the task the family was broken and they were punished in a different way than regular way. But defeating all odds, the family got together and defeated their boss. This is what happened but with all the action shenanigans and drama bits. What disappointed me was the real face of Taskmaster. They pulled another Wanda Vision scheme for Taskmaster. However I have to appraise the opening credits which is one of the best if not one of the best opening scenes of MCU. The action was excellent. And the end credits were very important for future of MCU.Black Widow is a shakeup in the Marvel slate. It's more of a spy thriller than a superhero movie and another proof that anything is possible with family. The actions were super synchronized and awesome. However it struggles to strike a balance between family and drama.

I can't stand the movies with men being evil and women being the only good. Men bad, women good. That whole narrative. I'm sick of it. However, this isn't that kind of movie. It really isn't. Everyone in it was good. I actually enjoyed it...most of it anyway. I'll get to that in a second. But, Florence was definitely the brightest star in the movie. I love Scarlett in anything, in my opinion she always pulls off a badass hero. Harbur (sorry for the spelling) was actually a fun character. By reading the reviews first, I really thought this movie was going to a man hating, very liberal preaching, and strong feminist movie. I get some people like that kind of stuff, I just personally don't like politics in my superhero movies. This movie really wasn't that. If you find it offensive as a man, you've become too sensitive. It's an entertaining movie I'd watch again. Hell, I even want to show my dad this movie as I enjoy watching cool fight scene movies with him. It isn't the best Marvel movie, but it beats a couple of them in my opinion.Okay here's the part I just can't forgive. The reason I docked it down to a 7...almost gave it a 6, but I couldn't do that to Florence in this movie. The complete butchering of Task Master was just unforgivable. That wasn't him. Forget it being a gender swap for a moment, Task Master could have been a man and if played the same way, would be a fail. They got the character all wrong and he...she...looked awful. The guards in all black had a cooler helmet and appearance. Such a complete waste of an amazing and vastly interesting characters. Why?? Just why did they have to have Task Master in this movie? Why ruin all hopes to see a good Task Master in live action?? He should have been in a Captain America movie or at least maybe a Deadpool movie. Something where he could have shown off his incredible gift and ability, an ability he has without the silly computer goggles in that silly looking sad excuse for a paintball helmet. I've waited so long to see him in live action. The trailer killed some hope with the looks of him and being a mute for some reason. But it was so much worse. To put the cherry on top, they wasted a cool actress, Olga, in the film. Just such a frustrating and ridiculous choice to have Task Master written like this.If you can get pasted the lame paintball power ranger being controlled like a robot, I mean Task Master, you should enjoy this film.

The after credit scene is a definite confirmation that she'll be joining the marvel universe which I believe it will massively benefit the franchise although without giving away any spoilers, her reasoning for being added is incredibly poor.I do believe that this film would have been way better if it was released before end game and would have made black widow's death far more tragic considering we would have known more about her background.As someone who doesn't enjoy marvel films, I do find it incredibly frustrating how these films aren't being released in more of a linear order so that people that don't want to waste their time watching every single garbage movie they push out in order to understand what the hell is going on, can follow the plot.Also I do believe that western cinema in general suffers from not hiring actors who's natural accents match the characters they play. It's incredibly painful to sit through a 2 hour movie and hear an American try and portray a Russian, the accents come across incredibly stereotypical. Marvel films shouldn't need to bring in recognisable faces anymore considering the size of their audience. Instead they should use their massive fanbase to bring in lesser known actors from different nationalities, therefore boosting the careers of lesser known actors and giving the characters a more authentic feel.My rating does feel fairly harsh considering I did somewhat enjoy the film however there are far too many irritating details with the film that annoyed me and my slightly biased hatred towards movies from the marvel franchise and how badly it's affected the movie industry simply won't allow me to rate it any higher. For those that watch films for fun or to unwind then I would recommend this film, however for those that still see the film industry as an art I'd advise to stay away."}, {"reviewer_name": "austinroy-36294", "date": "19 July 2021", "text": "( This is my first movie review on this app so take this review with a grain of sand. With my reviews I don't like going into what the movie was when it came to editing and cinematography but I will touch on that ).In order for you to understand my thoughts going into the movie I'm going to explain exactly what my expectations where. I am a massive movie and superhero nerd. If you were to ask any of my friends that watch movies they would tell you that one of my top 10 favourite Marvel movies is Captain America \"The Winter Solider\". While I was searching and looking around youtube and the internet as most people do, I found a certain amount of videos and articles online that had stated that this movie was going to be like Captain America The Winter Solider. After hearing this my expectations for this movie were very positive and I was ecstatic to watch this movie. My sister and I, who also loves to watch Marvel movies decided to give the movie a shot and buy it. I was going into this movie thinking I was going to come out happy and have had a good time.After the post credit scene which I will get back to, I felt one word, empty. I felt that this movie didn't serve a purpose and that it felt like a lazy attempt to set up an evil avengers storyline. I felt that the movie was your basic Marvel movie, funny scenes, action, suspenseful moments, a good story and great character building. I will break down each of these in paragraphs to explain how I feel about the movie.When it came to comedy it was your basic comedy, you either laugh at the jokes or know that there was a joke trying to be told but you just blocked it out. I believe there was only one funny scene I laughed out loud at which was when the helicopter crashed ( if you watched the movie you would know ). Overall the comedy was average.When it came to the action, yikes, what to say about the action. This might be some of the most boring and worst action I have ever scene in a Marvel movie. I feel that movies need to have a purpose for action scenes or at least if a movie has a purpose to the actions scenes then it is better. The action scenes felt like they would just happen because the film would just be boring. After every Marvel movie that I've seen I've always wished that I had helped create those exact scenes. After this movie I felt like even an average Marvel fan would be able to create a better and more creative fight scene. The only fight scene that I would say was somewhat interesting was when Black Widow fought Taskmaster on the flying building as it fell to the ground. Even that scene ended bad as the scene ended with black widow and taskmaster just fighting on the ground for around 30 seconds. Overall the action was terrible.When it came to suspense I felt nothing. It sucks because you already know how this movie is going to go, none of black widows family is going to die, the main villain will be defeated or die ( not talking about taskmaster ). The suspense wasn't as good of a movie, comparing it to Captain America. Overall didn't feel any suspense in the film.When it came to the story it was just a basic go there go here, get this and end of movie. Black Widow sadly felt useless in this movie which is funny since its called Black Widow. I felt that the plot was moving and the side characters just moved and pulled Black Widow with them. When it came to the post credit scene I was some what excited as it gets me a hyped for the Hawkeye show. Overall the story was basic.When it came to character building I honestly believe that if this movie came out before endgame ( which it originally was supposed to ) I would have felt the same same way about Black Widow. This didn't make me like or hate black widow more it just made me say \" hey there's Black Widow, she dies in endgame \". This is no disrespect to the character of Black Widow as I feel she is the best and my favourite female marvel hero and Scarlett Johnson has put her heart into this role but at the end of it this doesn't improve on her character. The only good and best character from this film that I loved and everyone else seems to love is Florence Pughs character, she is so great in this movie. She was the only one in the film that actually was and seems like will be an important character. The other side characters are fine at best they serve their purpose to the story and I don't care whether or not they show up again. I do have to say though that David Harbours character was a very entertaining character as his scenes were the only one that either made me laugh or made me want to. The villain of the movie, Dreykov, is the worst and most basic superhero villain of all time. Take a guess what his goal is, did you say it was to take over the world well..., OF COURSE ITS TAKE OVER THE WORLD WHAT ELSE WOULD IT BE, YOU THINK IT WOULD ACTUALLY BE AN INTERESTING AND HEARTBREAKING MOTIVATION, NO. THIS LOSER OF A VILLAIN JUST FELT LONELY AND DECODED HE WANTED TO TAKE OVER THE WORLD, WHEN HE DIED I LAUGHED OUT LOUD AND IT WASN'T EVEN SUPPOSED TO BE FUNNY IT WAS JUST SO DUMB THAT I NEEDED TO LAUGH. When it came to the actual villain everyone wanted to see, Taskmaster, it was disappointing. I don't wanna get in a massive rant like people are about Taskmaster but I just felt that she wasn't threatening and she was just there to make the movie have more action scenes. Overall the character building is mediocre.Overall this movie felt disappointing even though my expectations weren't the best, I feel that if this movie was cancelled I wouldn't even care. Is it worth the 40 dollars I payed no. If you are going into this movie just wanting to watch and have a silly good time then yes its worth it but for a marvel movie it goes beside Captain Marvel as an average super hero movie ( and I haven't even finished Captain Marvel ).My score for this movie is a solid 5 out of 10."}, {"reviewer_name": "mrmillerqs", "date": "17 July 2021", "text": "Tremendous action throughout the show, really fun experience in IMAX.

It should be a 3 to 1 split not a 50:50 split as far as dry jokes and sarcasm goes.This movie just felt like it was a decade too late. Fans had been asking for this movie since the first Avengers film essentially. It would have been better if we got a blackwidow and Hawkeye back in 2012-2015.But I do understand this movie was needed to fully introduce our new Blackwidow and to shoe her in and we got a good one, FP is absolutely perfect for the role which takes me to the only real positive, the cast.The cast carried this movie on their back's 110%. From Scar-jo to Rachel Weisz to David Harbour and especially Florence Pugh. If this movie didn't have such a solid cast it would not have been worth the price of admission.So definitely a bottom tier MCU movie.

No where near as bad as Captain Marvel or Black Panther.There are flaws in the movie, but they do not tear it down to a bad level - they just keep it from rising to a better rating.Scarlett. Johansson had always been a rather average performer. Another reason to doubt this film. The surrounding cast pushes the film ahead and makes it work.Is it anything new? No - and in the beginning the same old car/motorcycle chase you have seen over and over makes you think that the film would crash. Once the film gets the crew (the four characters from the first ten minutes) back together is when the film becomes interesting.The one glaring weakness was the portrayal of Taskmaster.

Deadpool, Thor Ragnarok, and Guardians of the Galaxy, perhaps the best reviewed and most creator driven of Marvel films.So it's little wonder it gets replicated. Here though, it's getting cringe. It's not that the jokes are bad, in fact Florence Pugh has an incredible talent for comedy. It's just that it's \"everywhere\" - especially at the 45 minute mark.There is very little for Scarlet Johansson to do. In fact, she seems incidental to her entire movie. I'm almost certain you could more or less write Black Widow out of her own movie, replace her with Yelena, and do the exact same plot. Some may say, well it's more about sisterhood, which is fine, but the main character can't be irrelevant to the plot.The movie is also tonally inconsistent. The Red Guardian we meet in prison behaves like a cartoon character. His appearance is even followed up by a cartoonish crash landing in their helicopter, like something out of a Looney Tunes commercial.Do I really want to criticize this movie? Can't I just let it go, call it \"fine\"? No. Because Scarlet Johansson should've gotten a Black Widow film ten years ago, and it would've been way better then. They punted, until they killed her off, to just poop out a script that was \"filmable\", and then broom her after all her hard work.There are also many clear pacing issues with the script. The movie doesn't honestly \"get going\" until minute 45, that's when we finally learn \"the mission\". There's a lot of unnecessary set up in the beginning to establish that Black Widow \"has a safe house\". We know she has a safe house. Also! How she got \"the vest from Infinity War\" - because she didn't \"just buy it\" like people do some times. Reminded me a bit of Solo, which means I'll be calling this \"underrated\" in a few years. So there's that.So while I've seen people rate this between a 6 and 7 out of 10, I feel like it ought to have been at least an 8/10. I wouldn't pay $29.99 to see it, which I did, I would either see it in a cheaper theater - that will at least enhance the good special effects - or wait the 45 days."}, {"reviewer_name": "bradykitchen-33648", "date": "17 July 2021", "text": "Good:\nActing was awesome especially from Florence Pugh she was phenomenal.Loved Florence Pugh's character along with David Harbours character both were greatPlot was good no complaintsVisually awesomeMixed:\nSince I know what happened in Endgame it took away from the action involving Black WidowBad:\nDidn't like the fight scene between the sisters felt weird and out of placeStart off small and lead into it.

Kind of like the alien you barely see is much scarier than the one you see in in plain view and all the script is dedicated to convince you the monster is scary. This movie is the same way, where it's overdone.Overall I he movie has the typical happy hour lucky fight scenes and not too much depth throughout. However the early credit scenes splash human trafficking of girls in a manner that has a gritty feel that feels slapped on, because none of the movie really caries that weight or continued cinematography feel. At the end they slap some script add on to talk about women maltreatment throughout the world in the script. But that too feels slapped on. I am not opposed to the shining light on a legitimate issue. But please carry the torch through the door hole movie equal to the weight of the subject matter. You can't show a scene of a kid choking kn a toy, then slide into toy story 4. It doesn't flow and it undercuts real world issues.There is woman good and men bad tones in the movie, but it doesn't feel as in your face as other films as of late.I did love that my daughter and wife liked it. Finally having more female lead movies was refreshing. The fight scenes seemed way out if the real of realistic, even for marvel. Especially considering all characters were just humans (sans 1 in robot suit) with no real superpowers (other than Russian training and chemicals to control the widows) to speak of.Neither villain (robot or Russian mastermind) felt developed enough for me to see as scary or invested in their character.The movie really is just 3 hours of non stop fighting. And literally everyone fights everyone. Which often makes no real sense other than adding time. To be honest , it was so much, I got bored. You can have a finale, if the whole movie is at the same level.The plot in some parts just felt like a white wash of captain America without a superhero serum.I could go on, but you get the point. It's just frustrating how can marvel make me so invested in black widow in early movies or female Loki in the tv show Loki....but then so under deliver in black widow.

There were effective smatterings of humor and some heavier moments when Natasha and Yelena discussed their Red Room training.A lot of Marvel purists were disappointed by the re-working of Taskmaster, and while I do see this as the waste of an opportunity to introduce a more comic-faithful version of him in the MCU, I do feel that the villain was fairly effective within the plot of the movie.I think the ending and post-credits scene leave some interesting avenues for the MCU to explore, and I look forward to seeing where they lead."}, {"reviewer_name": "subhavnogia", "date": "10 July 2021", "text": "THIS REALLY WAS A BIG SUPRISE PACKAGE !

Considering all that's happened in the MCU recently with her character, and it's incredibly delayed release, I felt like the time had passed for a Black Widow solo film. Surprisingly though, I found myself quite entertained and moved by some of the moments of the film, and although it wasn't great, it did prove to be better than I had anticipated. By far the best thing about the film is Florence Pugh's performance as Yelena, aka Natasha's sister. Through her character we get a greater depth not only into a magnificently written character, but also the world of Natasha herself, and the pains that have burdened each of them for a long time. Strangely enough, in this marvel movie, by far the best moments are when it slows down and takes a time to tell it's story- as well as clear up the emotional depth each character has had to deal with. The action scenes are decent, nothing too special. I adore the costumes and really liked the films score. Towards the final act of the film, we seen to have a deterioration in quality though- it being just a bit too convoluted to have as much fun or as much as an impact as it could have had.

Featuring a standalone story that unfolds between the events of Civil War & Infinity War, the film is a late entry in the saga and there is simply nothing about it that's refreshing or even worth the wait.Directed by Cate Shortland, the story digs into the human attributes of Natasha Romanoff way better than previous chapters ever did and even packs a more compact & structurally sound plot that navigates into her past & unresolved trauma & broken relationships. The opening credits do hint at a darker, riskier premise & even set up the tone for the same but then the narrative takes a different route that's safer & more akin to Marvel formula.As expected, fast paced action, overblown CGI & familiar wit go hand in hand with the drama but the story is self-contained & stakes are smaller this time around. The family dynamic while promising at first isn't explored to its full potential but the siblings bonding adds some weight to the film's emotional requirements. Scarlett Johansson is terrific in her final outing as Black Widow yet she is outshined & overshadowed by Florence Pugh who's an absolute live-wire in her role.Overall, Black Widow arguably is better focused than many other entries in the MCU but other than Pugh's stellar debut in this shared universe, there's nothing in here that's impressive or noteworthy. There are no money shots, no memorable segments & no revelations that leave a lasting mark. Nothing to help the film separate itself from the crowd.

I was so excited when they announced a Black Widow movie, I also was in denial about Natasha's death in Avengers: Endgame (2019), and I thought that somehow she was still alive due to the way her life ended. I didn't want anyone to replace her and when the first trailer of Black Widow came it was obvious that this film was more about getting to know Yelena, the one who could be her replacement as the new Black Widow and I couldn't accept Yelena because I was still holding on for Natasha. Though I completely changed my mind when I watched the film, Yelena was quite a character! She was amazing and she would bring an interesting spunky perspective in being the new Black Widow. I can't wait when she would be taking up the mantle and be the official addition to the Avengers. The movie approach was different than the other films in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, it didn't feel like a superhero film, it felt more grounded giving it a more realistic approach. There is nothing wrong if it felt like any other superhero film but it didn't and I welcome this new fresh take on it. The action was non-stop, it kept me excited and on the edge most of the time. I was getting thrilled to watch more female action sequences. Also, how perfectly the humor was balanced in the film, I caught myself smiling in every humor scene made me easily and quickly like so much all the main characters. I dare say it was the best Marvel film and it is in my number one spot. This story hit me emotionally and what made it great was the sister bond.There were only two things I didn't like about the movie, the first one was Rachel Weisz's makeup. It was very distracting watching her eyeliner be smeared or faded and then it was better but it didn't last long. It started the moment she put the suit on and I don't get what was going on with her eyeliner. She is beautiful as always but the eyeliner being different in so many angles distracted me from watching her performance, because watching it smeared and then on again and then smeared again was like pulling me out of the assassin world. The second thing I didn't like about the film was the confrontation between Natasha and the main villain. Every scene clicked perfectly but suddenly that particular whole scene changed the film's atmosphere. That part was struggling to keep the movie up, and thankfully when the main villain was no longer there in that certain scene the film once again felt back to its fantastic tone.The composer Lorne Balfe, also blew my mind with his music. Every time the main theme appeared I was drawn to the scene even more. His music really understood Black Widow's storyline and gave it the push the film needed. The song chosen for the opening credit was perfect, it is the cover of Smells Like Teen Spirit by Nirvana and the film version cover was by Think Up Anger featuring Malia J. The way she sang that song was more deep and emotional it captured beautifully the feeling of being forced to turn into something not chosen to be.The cast was magnificent especially the main, Scarlett Johansson, Florence Pugh, Rachel Weisz, and David Harbour. Watching one last time Scarlett Johansson being Natasha Romanoff was exciting and heartbreaking at the same time. I can't wait to watch Florence Pugh as Yelena again. I was stunned at how I quickly accepted her but not shocked because her performance was on point and her chemistry with Scarlett Johansson was natural. I would have loved to watch more scenes of them together in action or having more bonding moments."}, {"reviewer_name": "hfreinoso", "date": "13 July 2021", "text": "Let me start by saying that I LOVE Black Widow, and she deserved to be in a stand-alone movie. And when it was announced after Endgame, I groan. (I always state Endgame is the last MCU project I was going to watch... and look at that, I lied.) But, I loved her in any movie she was in, and when it was her time to shine, it was suitable for about 20-30 minutes, and I loved the first act, then... yeah. Both Florence Puch and David Harbour were outstanding as Red Guardian and Yelena Belova, respectively, and heck, they stole the spotlight from Natasha more in her solo film. And of course, Scarlett Johannson was, in fact, Black Widow, and she knocked it out of the park. And the chemistry between Johansson and Puch was perfect and felt like a REAL sister relationship. And sadly, that was just it... that was all that I liked about this film. So, this is entirely down for me cause I wanted to like this film.I didn't like most of what I saw, and the reason is that they tried to do so much, but it came out so diminutive, and the way they deliver some plot twist, something similar to Iron Man 3. When Natasha finds out that Dreykovs (the main villain) daughter, who she thought she killed, earlier in the film was indeed the Taskmaster, the way it was delivered and handled was poorly done, let alone that they are again robbing the actual Taskmaster. I know who the Taskmaster is, and the way the MCU showed this again is so stupid and embarrassing it was honestly disappointing. The CGI was also noticeable; for instance, a man was on the jet that Natasha's family was in, and it looked so fake!! And the ending, how did she escape from General Ross? Again, that doesn't make any sense of how she escaped from him and the army. I thought she would escape with her family, and then she would later meet with Rogers, Wilson, and more. But that doesn't happen. Overall the movie was okay, and It had some good moments but nothing special again from the MCU. I feel like I needed more and needed a proper send-off to Natasha since we aren't probably going to see her anymore. And yet, they plan on putting more sequels and spin-offs from this film.

I just wanted to bring the score up. Because in no way is this the worst MCU film...nor is it even the worst First Solo MCU film (a la Thor 1, Captain America, Captain Marvel, Dr. Strange, etc)I think this movie is so much fun! Scarlet Johansson finally got some material to show off her acting chops in End Game and they killed her minutes later because Hawkeye had a family? I was never a Scar Jo or Widow fanboy but the ending of End Game just didn't sit right with me so I was rooting for her ever since. And compared to movies like Infinity War, End Game, Black Panther, Ragnarok, etc of course it can't hold a candle to those movies. However for being it's own thing but being related to Marvel it 1000% worked!Scar Jo finally got to act, got some great action scenes, depth to her character, and a personality. Plus she did a great job producing!The movie itself though was perfect and wouldn't really change much about it. For one the pacing was absolutely INSANELY GOOD! There was never an unnecessary long drawn out scene. There was never any action scenes that felt like they were never ending. There was a perfect balance! Just when you were thinking hmm I could use some action or something funny or exciting to happen right now it would and just when you needed a breather from the action they gave you a well written and INCREDIBLY DELIVERED DIALOGUE SCENE that actually moved the story forward.The fight scenes were off the chain amazing for Marvel and I hope they move more in that direction to be quite honest! I want a little violence and things to look like they hurt in my super hero movies. I mean a punch from Black Panther or a shield to the face should look sort of brutal if you think about it. Anyways the non-hand to hand fighting action scenes like THAT TANK CHASE SCENE or the final SKY BATTLE(I mean a SKY BATTLE?! How bad a$$?!) were really well done as well. And sure things were over the top and wild but they needed to give Black Widow her WOW type action/final battle moment. Plus everything else was fairly grounded for the MCU and comparing the \"Sky Battle\" to almost every other MCU film's battles it isn't too crazy. You arent expecting an Oscar winning period piece drama where every little detail is exactly true to life when you're watching a Marvel movie.The dramatic scenes in this movie really made me feel exactly what they wanted and then some. And largely due to the incredible acting ability of the cast. From the intro that was just sooo soooo dark for a Disney/Marvel Studios film. Truly haunting! To the incredible scenes between Natasha and Yelena and their umm parents?...so good!The story was reallllly great! Much much more entertaining than I ever imagined to be honest. Maybe my low expectations made me love it more...but I don't think so because I've rewatched it a few times now and even after the First viewing of a Marvel film hype I still enjoy it just as much.The whole story about the chemical control and the antidote, the aspects of a complicated family that you still care about at the end of the day, introducing A INSTANT FAN FAVORITE YELENA and giving her the spotlight to get everyone on board while also allowing Natasha to shine. OH AND YALL WANTED SOME TWISTS EH? The twists throughout the movie I personally enjoyed and didn't see coming and I am normally so on point with seeing things coming like that. I figured the Taskmaster twist out a split second before the reveal and I didn't see the ol switcharoo Mission Impossible mask twist coming at all!! I also didn't fully expect all of the other Widows to be the bad guys under mind control.And just to touch on the Taskmaster twist. I completely see why some feel how they were defeated was a bit underwhelming. But to me it made sense. Natasha had to at least attempt to make things right. And as for just not liking their version of Taskmaster...I think it had to be done that way. Or at least come up with a way to the very human Black Widow an imposing iconic villain fans would recognize to get people to watch it but also not make them too strong to where it wouldn't be believable for her to win.Think about it this movie without Taskmaster yeah would still have been great and could have been done almost the same...but would it have sold tickets especially after fans already know Natasha is dead and can probably still know what is going on in the MCU without seeing it. So I totally feel Taskmaster being in the film was necessary.Then addressing Taskmaster's power from the comic books on screen that isn't the easiest of TASKS..haha. So they had to come up with a way that allowed them to explain Taskmaster's powers, display that power visually, make Taskmaster a fair villain for Black Widow, and have it make sense in the MCU. Sure they could have made them a super human with a freaky mind that allows them to instantly predict your next move in battle/fights as well as be freaky strong without any explanation as to how or why. But I'm glad they explained how and why...and NOT ONLY DID IT MAKE SENSE, ADDED A SURPRISE TO THE MOVIE, TIED IN WITH NATASHA'S OVERALL STORYLINE THROUGH ALL THE MCU (a past brainwashed spy who broke free and has been trying to make up for her past wrongs..if you think about it their stories kind of\nmirror one another like Taskmaster mirrors their opponents moves), etc.....BUT NOW THIS OPENS THE DOOR FOR ANOTHER TASKMASTER TO SHOW UP DOWN THE LINE! I mean we already got how many Captain America type characters now? Cap, all of the Flag Smashers, John Walker/ U. S. Agent, Isaiah Bradley, Bucky Barnes, all of the Winter Soldiers, etc.So just like they brought new Super Soldiers into the fold after Cap they can do the exact same with Taskmaster because it is a scientific/technology based procedure that can be replicated.And if your main gripe is Taskmaster being a girl I don't know what to say really?But I do want to leave this one a few final thoughts....1.) Did anyone expect this movie to be a top 5 MCU film? If not why are some of you treating it as if it should have been so there for it is complete trash?2.) Is it possible that SOME people out there let their expectations and biases negatively impact their experience watching this movie and your opinions about it? I don't think every person who didn't like the movie is only because their expectations or biases or their opinions are invalid...I just think that SOME of them may be going in a little harsher than necessary."}, {"reviewer_name": "grztxks", "date": "12 July 2021", "text": "This movie is not bad, it's just disappointing.

Big scenery and big action need a big stage. I see that on the IMDb rating scale, female viewers give it a 7.5, almost a full point higher than the male viewers, and I don't have any problem siding with the women. On screen, they're the ones who get almost all the action (including a whole room full of Red Room trainees near the end, which is kind of what we were expecting).It must have been frustrating for Scarlett Johansson, who's a good actor, to have her Black Widow character treated so inconsistently in the MCU. In the previous Avengers, Iron Man, and Captain America films first she's a SHIELD deep-cover operative, then a former spy coupled with Hawkeye, then on the run with Steve Rogers, then a love interest with Bruce Banner, then the one keeping the lights on at Avengers headquarters post-Snap, and finally the one to make the ultimate sacrifice so that the Big Guys can save the universe. So this film is long overdue -- the Marvel Studios suits really don't have any excuse for stalling this long to make a female-centered superhero movie (the first one being Captain Marvel, but that was already TEN YEARS after the Big Guys had the field all to themselves). Black Widow should have had a setup pre-Avengers film just like Tony Stark, Cap, Thor, or Hulk. This film gives Natasha much of the backstory she deserves along with a good standalone adventure.So the basic style they chose to work with for the Black Widow solo is James Bond. Fair enough -- her character isn't superpowered, she was trained as a spy, so it matches well enough. Just like any Bond film, it's a thin cover for international country-hopping, lots of hand-to-hand combat, guns, cars, motorcycles, aircraft, and over-the-top stunts. There's all of that you might want and the production values are high.As we know very well by now, Marvel likes to hire actors for both big and small roles who are already established as top-notch. As any of the trailers show, Florence Pugh plays Natasha's \"sister\" (Yelena, technically more like a stepsister I guess) and has a substantial part that is obviously intended to continue forward to later productions, somehow (I suspect in the upcoming Hawkeye series?). She does well and is the source of much of the side humor in the script, though physically she doesn't quite have the stature that Johansson does for this type of role. I thought Rachel Weisz was excellent, and David Harbour was good as well. Beyond those central four, there are just stock villains and side characters.Moment-by-moment it's very involving to watch, even if you don't know all the previous MCU history. But when you think about it later, it kind of disconnects into a bunch of set pieces that don't fit very smoothly. Why exactly did we jump to Morocco? Budapest? Then somewhere in Russia, and finally the famous Red Room that turns out to be a fortress in the clouds, I guess because why not. It goes smash so much better that way at the end. Also we watch Natasha go through cycle after cycle of taking (and dishing out) ferocious punishment and keep on ticking. At the end she isn't even limping a bit. So it's action fulfilment for the devout fans, but I don't think scaling it down just a little bit would have done any harm.And about the post-credits scene: well done at the start, but then took a jarring sideways turn that left a bad taste in my mouth. It really broke the mood that the whole movie had worked to establish."}, {"reviewer_name": "Flippo9204", "date": "24 July 2021", "text": "This was (again with Marvel) exactly what I needed: something different, but still a Marvel film.I really like the dynamic between the characters, it felt real.On a film level, however, I felt misjudged.

Black widow was a fantastic film, it was definitely more flawed than a lot of marvel films, but I still enjoyed myself a lot.My first few positives for black widow would be the fantastic cinematography and action. The great character background, the fantastic chemistry between the cast as well as the great family dynamic. As expected with the MCU the cinematography and attention to detail with its visuals was excellent. It was beautifully and professionally shot. With excellent uses of red to reflect the tone of the film well as well as the characters. I also liked the visual imagery to represent key stages of Natasha's life and how they were repeated during different scenes. The action was also fantastic. It was thrilling, exciting and excellently choreographed, also a lot more gritty and hard hitting than a lot of previous MCU movies which I appreciated. I also really appreciated the character background. The opening scene set up Natasha and her family well. Establishing her life prior to the avengers, it was interesting to finally see how Natasha was growing up as a child so this was a nice element to the film. I also loved the fantastic family dynamic and the chemistry between the cast. This was definitely one of the strongest elements of the film for me. The whole family dynamic was so believable and fun. They came across as a genuine albeit unconventional family that needed to patch things up. Scarlett, Florence, David and Rachel all did fantastic jobs here and there on-screen chemistry was excellent. Especially Scarlett Johansson and Florence Pugh who worked so well together here, there sister bond was excellently written and Florence is a deserving replacement for Natasha.My next few positives would be the building of tension. Darker themes, great worldbuilding and character depth. As well as great performances and comedic dialogue. I thought the film managed to build tension very well, this was largely due to the much darker themes for Marvel. The opening scenes and the amount of detail they went into how they trained the Widows and how they separated them from their families was surprisingly tough to watch, and as I learned more about the widows the tension increased amazingly with the villain behind it all as well as the action. I thought the worldbuilding was also great, it filled in a few holes within the timeline of the movies as well as Natasha's character. Building on the red room and Natasha's dark past was well explored. Therefore, the film had strong character depth. As we discovered Natasha's dark past and her regrets, as well as trying to get to the bottom of who her true family was it gave the needed depth to her character that was missing from some of the previous entries within the MCU therefore making this standalone feature for me worth people's time in terms of learning more about her character. I also appreciated the depth they gave to Yelena (Florence Pugh) as well, her being free of the mind control of the widows was a really interesting element, and just sad to see her go into so much detail about the widow's lack of freedom and having so many things taken away from them. The performances here were great the main 4 cast members were fantastic. Scarlet Johansson was brilliant, she bought the grounded and passionate performance expected from the character of Natasha and she didn't disappoint. Rachel Weisz was also fantastic showing she can hang with the younger cast members well. David Harbour was brilliant, his comedic timing was excellent and Red Guardian was a great character. What helped was the excellent comedic writing for his character, it was witty, well timed, and genuinely funny and David just made it work. But the star of the film was Florence Pugh. Wow what a star making performance. She delivered in every aspect needed. She delivered in the action, the more serious and emotional side to her character. But she also bought this fresh humour to the film and had some excellent moments.However, the film was far from perfect. My negatives for Black Widow would be the rushed scenes, underused villains, lack of detail to the deeper themes. As well as the off-putting CGI in the final act. There were certain scenes that needed more explanation and more time to breathe, considering how detrimental they were to the whole film, there was just certain scenes involving the widows and how to free them that felt glossed over and lacked attention. I also thought that the villains were extremely underused. Despite some good explanation, the main villain was mediocre for the MCU and didn't have enough presence within the film to leave a lasting impact. There was a similar issue with Taskmaster as well, it felt like a missed opportunity with that character so hopefully she is bought back. I also thought that there was a lack of depth to the bigger themes. I felt like the film introduced the darker themes really well, but then never really went into any more detail with them, so therefore the films bigger messages were lost within the action. Finally, I thought the CGI in the final act was very off putting In places. There were just certain scenes that had badly done CGI involving characters faces. And CGI and green screen was overused for when the Red room was destroyed, as I wasn't a particularly big fan of the flying action scene.My final few positives would be the decent villain, explanation to the villain. The plot twists, the great character conflict and tone. As well as the great final act. Despite the villain overall being mediocre, I did appreciate his role within the film. I think Ray Winstone did a solid performance for the character to come across as intimidating and threatening, as well as being instantly dislikeable due to his treatment of the widows. I also liked the explanation and twists with his character. The background with his daughter being killed was a good motivation for his character and was well linked with Natasha's backstory. The twist with taskmaster was also well executed in my opinion and was a plot twist I didn't see coming. I also really liked the character conflict. The tension between Natasha and the villain and the conflict due to Natasha escaping the red room before was great. I also appreciated the conflict with the family, due to there troubled past and giving Natasha and Yelena away but not knowing where. Introduced some good conflict that was well explored and drew them all closer as a family. I also thought the film managed to execute a fantastic tone, switching between its more serious and emotional tone to its comedic tone very well. I also loved the spy espionage feel to it, fitting with the character of Natasha excellently. Finally, I thought the final act was great. Despite my issues with some of the action. It was thrilling, entertaining and gave Natasha and Yelena the closure they needed for there characters. The end credit scene was also excellent. Setting up Yelena's MCU future excellently.Overall, Black Widow misses the mark slightly with the villains and the deeper themes are lost within the action. But it is still and incredibly entertaining, intense and strong addition to the MCU Serving as both respect to Scarlet and what she has done with the character of Natasha, whilst also introducing us to the new phase of heroes with Yelena, with a star making performance from Florence Pugh.Overall rating 84/100."}, {"reviewer_name": "rajmondarestelica", "date": "24 July 2021", "text": "The movie we deserved in so long.

It was not a bad movie but it was a Yelena movie. I guess Black Widow will never have her own movie no matter what. The worst part is she was cooler in the avengers' movies. The fight, the driving, the smart and the feeling she projected were not as great. For Yelena however it was mind blowing. It feels like they tried to uncool her in order to make us like Yelena more because she will replace her as the new Widow. The movie feels too much like a Fast and Furious to me.

She's been kicking ass ever since Iron Man 2, and became a bit of a fan favorite. This movie is a perfect example of too little, too late. We've already seen some of her origin story scattered among other entries in the MCU, and then End Game happened, which was a rather definitive ending to the story arc of the original Avengers. But they promised us a Black Widow movie, so here it is I guess.Pro's: Action's done quite well, they take time to introduce the characters and as I said earlier Pugh's awesome.Con's: No real character arc for Black Widow in her own movie, supporting cast of Harbour and Weisz underused, the plot isn't very interesting, underwhelming finale.This one's hard to recommend. I had an okay time watching it, and it's competently enough made, but it doesn't have many selling points.

I really missed watching one of Marvel's good superhero movies, especially a hero from the original six, who we haven't seen its film yet. However, I had lost interest in the movie because of the long break, and I did not have many expectations. I thought that it would be a classic and average Marvel movie. Unfortunately, the film was even less than I expected.If we divide the movie into two halves, I would say that the first half satisfied me. Even though there were still things that I didn't like as a whole, which I will come back to them, the first half of the movie had a clear story and goal. Taskmaster was also looking cool and scary; it reminded me of the WinterSoldier. It was what I define as a classic Marvel movie.On the other hand, the second half of the movie lost its focus. Many weird things start to happen one after the other. There were moments (for example, the flashbacks of the original plan) that felt very cliche. The Taskmaster also turned out to be not the guy many of us thought.Now, let's talk about the things that I did not like in general. I think the movie failed to introduce the main bad guy of the film, Dreykov, and the story of BlackWidow. As I told you, I liked the first half. Nevertheless, these things troubled me mainly in the first half. The film has brief scenes that are about the past of BlackWidow and Dreykov (flashbacks that are like a maximum of 5 minutes). I believe that it does not give us the necessary back story of the Red Room. And because the film revolves around those lacked scenes, I just started to not give a damn about what they were talking about and what was happening towards the end. In my opinion, the main reason behind this is that they focused on Yelena and that family issue more than BlackWidow itself. I think they could have reduced some of the dialogue scenes to show us more flashbacks, but still, it wouldn't be enough. It would be much better if they just focused on BlackWidow and the RedRoom. I also think that Natasha is not the same person that we know from the other movies. I believe the reason for this is also because the film is not focused on her. In addition, it would be cooler if Taskmaster was the master of the RedRoom and the main villain of the movie.I normally would have given 5.5, but there isn't such an option, and because of my respect for Marvel itself, I will give 6."}, {"reviewer_name": "WKYanks", "date": "21 July 2021", "text": "An enjoyable watch for the most part.

It almost at times felt that Black Widow as not the focus of her own movie. Scarlett is fantastic as always and I enjoyed the addition of Florence Pugh as Yelena. David Harbour is enjoyable as \"Red Guardian\", but I don't care that I now know what that character is or was supposed to be.The comedy felt forced at times with Yelena getting the most laughs from me.The CGI, etc. Are off the charts as in all the Marvel movies.Marvel needs to move on and come up with some new stuff... this was, yet again, hero has conflict with someone they are emotional about, they have to fight, they make up, the bad guy is floating around somewhere in plain site, they have a big fight at the end and the good guys win. We've seen enough of this.I think the Black Widow character (and Scarlett) deserved more and I'm sad that #1, this movie wasn't made and run right after 'Civil War' and #2, that this movie didn't provide a sufficient emotional punch for one of Marvel's best and well developed characters.

Yet, this film was not the train wreck that I was expecting. For every wrong turn or poorly crafted element there seemed to be two positives. In other words, two steps forward and one step back. While that formula isn't the most pleasant journey, it gets you where you need to go. That's the definition of this movie at this late time... a satisfactory film that delivered Natasha's back story in a proficient manner. It's not completely soulless but leaning heavily in that direction. The action isn't noteworthy but it's not pathetic either.The more you digest the film, the more middle of the road it gets as there are some things to like and some things to roll your eyes at and hate. The Taskmaster for instance is an absolutely pathetic villain. The main villain pulling the strings was a straight up \"mustache twirling\" evil guy for the sake of evil. He had all the depth of an Austin Powers villain or an over-the-top bad guy Liam Neeson would kill at the end of one of his movies. Another huge negative was that everything had to be spelled out as if the audience had the intellect of a small child. They left no dots to be connected at all, often telegraphing every turn. It was predictable to the point of nausea. Also, the \"mother\" character delivers another female antagonist in this phase of the MCU that commits horrible crimes and acts and never answers for them at all.I did like the supporting cast of Yelana and the Red Guardian. It seems to me that they passed the Black Widow baton properly from one sister to another. I did enjoy the call backs to past films.Overall, cutting it slack for what has come before might be its saving grace. Otherwise, it's completely middle of the road in every way.

First, even tho Black Widow has been around for like 10 years in the MCU, she still isn't one of my favorite characters. Second, because they released it after the character have died in the previous movie (Avengers: Endgame). This movie could make me more excited if they released it on the same timeline as the movie take place, 2016/2017. It just feel kinda weird that they put this as the first movie of MCU Phase 4.The film starts off very strong with establishing Natasha Romanoff's childhood and her family. And reveal how Nat ended up being a Black Widow. Actually one of the best opening from all Marvel movies in my opinion.Many people don't like how Marvel use Taskmaster in this movie. But I'm actually agree with that. My problem with the villain is that he just got small screentime and seems not threatening at all. I thought Taskmaster will be the next Winter Soldier kind of villain when I watch the trailers and then I was wrong. For the third act, yeah Marvel really have a problem with this. CGI fight scene is fine, but if they fail, it makes the whole scene and sequence look terrible.But beside all of that, this movie was doing great on telling the backstory of Nat and the way they respecting the character's death.

All the performances in this movie are very solid, however Florence Pugh in particular stands out to me as being very good in her role as she is in most things. The issue with the characters stems from the writing, as a lot of the comedy fails to land and I found it difficult to be emotionally invested.I don't think Black Widow was a bad movie in itself, but it failed to capture my attention with its plot and didn't break any records for great character writing. I think if the movie were to have been released pre infinity war I may have enjoyed it more, as it is difficult to connect to the movies main character in a prequel set before a movie so reality shifting as Endgame.

The music score was pretty good. There was a nice blend of some young/new and old actors.On balance they did pretty well for a Marvel/Disney production and it will probably keep the fans who are familiar with the rest of the franchise happy.

Before getting to far into the negatives, this movie does have the usual dose of Marvel action, stunts, and witty one-liners, but beyond that it's bogged down by its own self-righteous Indignation. The opening scene draws in, but feels forced, not flowing as one would expect given the interesting concept. The opening credits sequence struck somewhere between horrifying shock value and an ASPCA commercial only missing the pictures of sad puppies and the song \"In the arms of an angel\" playing in the background. The frequent time jumps and location swaps were handled somewhat poorly often failing to explain why things were happening and leaving the viewer an overall feeling of being unsettled. Rachel Weisz's character felt very poorly developed which was shocking for a film of this caliber and an actress of her capability. David Harbour's character was also a huge let down as despite the comic tie-in, he is poorly developed as a character and seems stuck in the well-meaning borish oaf category. The villain was underwhelming, the final setting too fantastic; but ultimately the biggest failure was the forced social commentary which seems to be taking over much of Hollywood. In the age of the \"me-too\" movement, social commentary is accessible and appropriate in many areas of life, I am just not sure it always works well in entertainment. The Marvel movie \"Black Panther\" was very well done, and the social messaging throughout the movie, though prominent didn't take away from the story or entertainment value. The movie \"Captain Marvel\", while trying to pull off female empowerment left the main character in limbo somewhere between roll-model and one-demensional social justice warrior. Likewise, the female empowerment moment near the end of the movie \"Endgame\" was so formalized as to almost feel forced and condescending. That's not to say the issues being touched on are not important, merely that that there is a time and place for everything and in entertainment they need to enhance the value not undermine it. This was by a fair margin the worst of this trend and distracts or undermines the story, plot development, character evolution and eventually the movie as a whole. Not worth the increasing prices to view for what ultimately feels like a really beautifully rendered social justice lecture.

All while delivering on the expected superhero action.It's a lot for any movie to accomplish and 'Black Widow' does some elements better than others.The script is by Jac Schaeffer (who created 'WandaVision') and Eric Pearson (who co-wrote 'Thor: Ragnarok', and who worked on the under-seen 'Agent Carter' tv series which also looked at the Red Room.)Romanoff is a spy by training. Spies (at least in the popular imagination) operate in murky, trust-no-one, shadows that take a toll not just professionally, but on their personal life. In the most recent 'Black Widow' solo comic series, Mark Waid embraced this side of her character, sending her on a series of impossible lone missions in which she had to heart-breakingly betray those closest to her for the greater good.The MCU has in the past alluded to Romanoff's need to atone for the red in her ledger, and the fact that she defected to America and SHIELD from Russia. We might imagine then that she wouldn't have many friends left in that part of the world. Given we know her ultimate fate in 'Avengers: Endgame', the movie wants to lift some of those burdens from Natasha's shoulders and assure her (and us) that she was loved, giving us some retrospective comfort about her sacrifice. To give her that, this movie is actually about Natasha putting her old family back together and reclaiming her place as a surrogate daughter and sister. She's does this to take down the still-operational Red Room in which kidnapped children are turned into mind-controlled deadly assassins.Putting the band back together is a well-worn movie trope and it works brilliantly here with Florence Pugh proving continuing the phenomenal hot streak she has been following 'Fighting With My Family', 'Midsommar' and 'Little Women'. She goes toe-to-toe with Johansson in the action scenes, and has great fun with her in the downtime between punches.David Harbour provides many laughs as Alexei AKA the Red Guardian - Russia's answer to Captain America. Harbour takes an insecure braggart who can't say the right thing and turns him into a decent guy who discovered too late what was important.The problem with all this is that it leaves Natasha sharing the limelight in her own movie. Where we could have had a fuller account and insight into what makes Natasha the Black Widow, we instead spend a lot of time understanding the wounded, bitterness of Yelena, and the out-to-pasture history of Rachel Weisz's under-written Melina.There's a definite feeling that if this movie had come ten years ago, it would have focused more tightly on Natasha and her history with the Red Room, but now, the MCU has more to think about, and the multiple missions can't all be fulfilled even in the two and a quarter hour runtime.Marvel is a well honed machine when it comes to action. From early on the film drops us into action, and it rarely lets up. From Norway to Budapest and on into Russia, there are one-on-one duels, car chases, aerial escapes and shoot-outs aplenty. They are all done with the usual level of breath-taking CGI, stunt work, and quips. I had only seen one previous film of director Cate Shortland - her debut feature, 'Somersault'. That is a lovely, touching piece of work about a girl trying to find her place in the world but it didn't prepare me for the level of mayhem in this movie. What is recognisable is her concern for the difficulty for a woman of trying to find her place in the world, and the importance of a decent support system.The evil villain's (played with a nice snarl by Ray Winstone) plot is woefully undercooked. He's manipulating countless women but his ultimate plan is a very vague, off-the-peg \"world domination\". His deadly right-hand, Taskmaster, is similarly underserved.It's admirable to want to allude to women breaking free of the control of monstrous men but when the method of that breaking free is a near magical red dust, it undercuts the work and effort it takes for women to actually get out from under either the literal trauma of an abuser, or the more pervasive patriarchal culture.By the end, 'Black Widow' has achieved a little of all the missions it set itself but had not truly completed any of them. A modest success then. Something that was enjoyable and a pleasure to see on the big screen but not the all-out storming of the cinemas we had wanted for Scarlett.Random thoughts:\n* First time back in an Imax screen post-pandemic - it was great to have those awesome visuals and sounds wrap around us once again.* There was at least one gratuitous butt shot, and I don't know how to feel about that in a film about female empowerment.* Loved the cheeky snippet of 'Moonraker'. Another movie about a spy facing a world-conquering villain but which is even more ridiculous than this one.* Speaking of Bond, Olga Kurylenko provides another connection as she had a big role in 'Quantum of Solace'\n* I know all action movies engage in a level of suspension of disbelief but there is a car crash in this in which Natasha's car roof is practically caved in as the car is bounced about, but she runs out as if it weren't no thing.* The Red Guardian was Russia's answer to Captain America and they sent him on an undercover mission for three years???!!! Hmmm.* If the Red Room is in Russia, how the hell is General Ross zipping about there in a very large, very not-secret convoy???* And speaking of General Ross, why even bother showing him towards the end if you're going to hand wave away what happened next with a \"two weeks later\"?* That post-credits scene did a lot of work - pushing the narrative forward by five-ish years, shedding some tears for Natasha, teasing the Contessa, and setting up the forthcoming 'Hawkeye'.* I love Marvel and I will go to see everything they put out from here until it all falls down, but I continue to be impressed by the level of care and craft that goes into making all of these movies and tv shows, and occasionally uniting them into one sweeping story. It really hasn't been done before on this scale in movies and tv and Kevin Feige has really got the secret sauce."}, {"reviewer_name": "stop_thebeat", "date": "11 July 2021", "text": "I've just seen this & honestly, it's ok.

What I really like about this movie is the fact that it's vastly different from the trailer and from expectations.This is an origin story for Yelena and her future in MCU.

It plodded along without developing any characters very well. I struggle to remember anything from it even though I watched it only 12 hours ago. They had a great story to build on, the transition from cold blooded killer to hero with a conscience. But they did nothing in that area, opting to go with some dysfunctional Guardians-esque band of motely misfits called a family. They didn't explore the built in story about being Russian interlopers at all. They didn't explore sister relationships at all. The didn't explore the toll it takes on children and spies in a foreign land. No intrigue.It felt like a mashup of Bourne, Matrix, Guardians, and general Marvel-ness, which in the end made the movie feel like a begrudged shout out 7 years late. Like when you skip a ride your kid wants to take and spend all day at the park. Exhausted and hungry as you start leaving after 8 hours, you remember you promised your kid you'd go on the ride.

Since that film some people really thought that now there would no more fun coming from MCEU but they were proven wrong with Spider Man : Far From Home. The makers had advantage of following the events after Endgame and so that Spidy flick came out really well, actually, even better than its predecessor. With Black Widow, MCEU has gone back to the time before Endgame amd Infinity War therefore the excitement of seeing something new was neve bulit up. Though, Marvel was smart enough to make a film on the character who had left the fans teary eyed so the sentimental back-up was there for sure. Thankfully, Black Widow is shaped well enough for the one time viewing even though it has made quite a mess out there with the weakest superhero present in the MCEU.Set after the events of Captain America: Civil War (2016), the film sees Romanoff on the run and forced to confront a conspiracy tied to her past. To be honest, Black Widow always looked the weakest in superheroes team because she doesn't hold any superpowers alongside HawkEye and so, having a film entirely carried by such a weak superhero was never meant to have a solid outcome. Of course, we aren't watching Christopher Nolan's Batman who had even less powers than RomanOff but Nolan is huge genius and that makes a big difference in the quality of filmmaking. Black Window kicks-off brilliantly and halfway through it surpasses all the normal expectations. But then it seems little dragged somewhere down the end and the overall excitement of solid content gets spoiled. But seriously before that dragging, it looked a fantastic film with superb action sequences and less use of larger-than-life explosion.Black Window is not a standalone film even with the characters of the film. If someone says that the lead superhero is sidekicked by a new character then you gotto agree. Performance wise, Scarlett Johansson is as good as she was in any Marvel film before but the real surprise here is Yelena. Florence Pugh plays this part and she looks hotter than Scarlett. Unfortunately, she didn't get as much action sequences as Scarlett or else she would have overshadowed her completely. David Harbour, Ray Winstone and Rachel Weisz are fine in whatever scenes they have got. The visual effects are not that great but the action sequences are. With technical aspects, Black Widow is neither dull not too good.The film do have some promising scenes that could stay with you for a while and it also have a good start given to HawkEye series we are gonna see in future. Cate Shortland's direction is worthy enough to make this flick one time watchable for fans and neutral audience as well. However, there was a scope for betterment which is surely wasted by the team. Overall, another action entertainer in MCEU that can be enjoyed by Fans as well as neutral movie lovers if they are not expecting something outstanding.RATING - 6.5/10*"}, {"reviewer_name": "eliiotbright", "date": "11 July 2021", "text": "Florence Pugh carried the whole film on her back.

Scarlett Johansson takes the role as Black Widow, who is an epic Marvel protagonist without any superpowers. The fight sequences in the film are stylish and the movement is skilful, but the \"acceptable\" story can be flat at times. However, fans of Marvel action flicks will surely adore Black Widow, despite the fact that it took a while for the character to have her own film.The film delivers a promising opening with a nicely-produced title card and credits. Although it does feel quite long and extended, it's usually entertaining when the story approaches the explosions, gunfire and action. Even though Black Widow doesn't have any superpowers like most other Marvel heroes, the film still keeps a similar pace for Marvel fans.This action/adventure tale also just isn't as great as expected. Even though the acting and effects are stunning, it isn't a fast-moving film and is occasionally just uninteresting. Thanks to the performances, action and fairly constructed story, Black Widow is another decent cinema-worthy movie that'll impress those who adore the epic action stories that Marvel provides."}, {"reviewer_name": "in-said", "date": "11 July 2021", "text": "SPOILER ALERT!I liked the movie and enjoyed it. What I liked was the relationship and bonding between Jelena and Natasha. Unfortunately some emotional complicated situations with very high tensions where solved very quickly and easy, as if nothing happened. A few twists where surprising and made it thrilling to watch. The sooundtrack of the movie was gorgeous and was in perfect symbiosis with the plot.The Action and fight scenes were good and exciting and there was a good mixture of high-speed pursuit and fight scenes. I am ok with action that is unrealistic, but in some scenes it was just absurd. And even for a MCU movie a little bit to much unbelievable stuff. Even the MCU has rules. If all rules of physics and biology are gone. What stays?The effects where nice, but i felt at some point that some expolosions, especially in the end, were quite cheap. You will see.As I have written already, the relationship between the family was outlined good. But I didnt like the fact that the clish\u00e9s of the stupid, alcoholic and heartless russians was used all the time.In some points the humor was nice, sometimes it was ridiclious and not funny.Biggest dislike was the fact that (like in James Bond Movies (Easter egg)) the villian tells all his secrets and his plans during the climax of the movie. That is a cheap solution.What I missed was more information about the training and brainwashing the girls went through their childhood. What was it that broke Natasha that she was able to kill a child...Interesting was that all Mercedes logos were deleted (Morocco: Taxi, Cuba: Dreikovs blue Mercedes ).Conclusion: Ok Movie.

It was like placing apples instead of pineapples on hawaiian pizza (though not everyone likes pineapples on their pizza). But seriously, if I were to choose who should have don the Taskmaster costume - it would be the long lost brother of Natasha Romanoff - I mean the story was all about family and the backstory of the Natasha - then why not make someone from her unknown past join into the MCU. In the comics Natasha had a brother named Vindiktor Romanov (it would definitely be an exciting story to know more about this storyline).The movie could have Vindiktor transformed into the Taskmaster by Dreykov as part of his revenge to Natasha for killing his daughter back in Budapest (with all of the brain washing experiments the red room has - this would be an interesting story to venture on). Yelena's story won't be sidelined to the story as she is the sister Natasha have grown to know with - thus making a sibling competition going into the story.The ending would even be interesting as Natasha finds out who the Taskmaster is (thanks to Dreykov), they fight in the end and Taskmaster dies at the hands of Natasha - or did he? - this will make a new story as a future villain for Yelena's Widow character or even better as a team partner in the future Thunderbolts team - the character of Taskmaster would have not gone into waste by poor storytelling for Dreykov's revenge. Natasha still dies in the Infinity War, Yelena becomes the new Black Widow, and Vindiktor (or maybe just rename him as Viktor) resurfaces with the Taskmaster character in the future MCU story.Yes the movie was good - but seems rushed and was not fully intended for Natasha's backstory but simply to introduce Yelena into the MCU.

No complaints with the casting choice, except for Ray Winstone. He looked like a chunkier version Geoffrey Rush. I think Rush would've made the character much more interesting.

It is here that lies the pleasant surprise of the movie, its greatest strength: giving Black Widow some more character development, deepening her profile as a character and leaving a post-Ultimatum legacy for her and the characters connected to her.I began watching this movie with a frustrated, cynical outlook, expecting a by-the-numbers cardboard flick of the Great Marvel Machinery, yet I found a heart in this story.

Actually there are a lot of negative points to talk about but I'll just include these which I see most important\n1. Rachel Weisz character (Melina) was such a waste! They could certainly use her as a mother figure in a way that could add more drama to most of the scenes.2. Speaking of drama, the movie has a huge lack of that, It is one of a few MCU movies that I couldn't relate to its characters or even feel sad for them and their story.3. I never really felt like that I should be afraid that something bad is gonna happen to the team because, simply, even they didn't, I'm not from the people who complain about the comedic scenes that ruin marvel movies but that movie's comedic scenes REALLY ruined the movie.4. Last but certainly not the least, the villain in that movie is so bad, actually he's now the 1st one on my list of the worst MCU villains, I think that's the only MCU villain that we didn't even know his motives, he just wants to control the whole world all 90s bad guys style. Yeah and if you're excited to see Taskmaster in that movie because you like the character from the comics, then you'll really be disappointed, and I mean REALLY disappointed.But hey, the movie wasn't the worst of all time after all, what do you think that 6 is for?! So, let's move to the good points!1. Florence Pugh and David Harbour's comedic roles were pretty good, especially Pugh's, the girl literally stole the movie from everybody else even Scarlett.2 The CGI is, as usual, pretty good and the movie is a pleasant visual experience.3. The movie, as a whole, is entertaining to watch, I mean that's why movies are made, right?To make it short and sweet Black Widow is a meh movie with a solid plot, a little drama and nice comedic scenes.

Just as a warning, I'm very spoiler-allergic, so my breakdown might include some spoilers and info that could reveal some key points.Overall, I thought Black Widow was a fun return to the movies, and the action sequences and snappy comedic dialogue makes it worth seeing in the theatre. After over a year stuck inside, it really made a difference to see Marvel on the big screen the way it's meant to be seen, with large sound, a huge picture, and a crowd that's on-board with the entire experience.I would rank Black Widow as a solid middle-of-the pack for MCU entries. It floats somewhere around Captain Marvel, the first Dr. Strange, and Iron Man 2: good, fun, plenty of action and some great one-liners and remarks that make callbacks to several established elements of the franchise, but also not what I'd consider to be in the top-tier of the saga at this point, either. Since Marvel has nailed it on so many of their releases, it's going to be harder and harder in the years to come for them to top their previous successes. I really hope that the new releases keep finding ways to push the limits, bend the genre, and add new elements us fans have been waiting to see.Pros:\n-the action sequences are for the most-part really well-shot and choreographed, with some great ideas featured in them\n-MCU newcomer Florence Pugh is outstanding as Yelena Belova, the alternate Black Widow in the comics, and in this version Natasha's sister. She handles the action and especially the humor really well, and provides the Eastern European accent that Scarlett Johansson's Widow never had\n-David Harbour is hilarious as the sister's adoptive father Red Guardian\n-The sisterly relationship between Natasha&Yelena is really well done, they both have great chemistry on-screen together and are the heart of the movieCons:\n-the action drops off in the middle section of the film, and while it sets up relationships and family ties, it starts to become a bit drawn-out and almost risks losing energy\n-we don't get enough of Natasha's origin&background, even in her own movie. The opening teases an awesome look at her childhood filled with tension and sets up a darker atmosphere, but then later on through the movie, it tries to shift the tone towards being more contemporary with huge action pieces and one liners (which as I mentioned, are still very funny)\n-Red Guardian, a character who's supposed to be the Russian equivalent to Captain America, is mainly there for comedic relief even though they set him up to be massively strong, and an asset to their mission. Harbour had me in stitches from his humor, but the script doesn't really justify much of a reason for him to be there story-wise\n-Taskmaster is under-utilized and is set-up to be a massive threat, but didn't pay off enough to my liking. I was hoping for a 3-way battle between Natasha, Yelena, and T. M. so that Yelena and Natasha could overwhelm T. M.'s battle-scanning abilities, but literally Hobbs&Shaw did this scene better, or, included it at all.It's great to see what happened to Widow's character after the events of the airfield battle in Captain America: Civil War. I don't think I'll ever get tired of the MCU filling in the gaps of the storyline that the movies don't cover, because there's so much they can still do in the past of the franchise that answers questions that linger, and connects dots that we've had to connect on our own so far.The only downside to releasing Black Widow after the character is (most-likely) perma-dead in the franchise is that when the tension rises in the movie, and you start to feel she's in danger, you immediately remember that she literally has to make it through all the events you're seeing, because she's there in Infinity War and Endgame.Another drawback I could've mentioned but didn't really bring up is that Ray Winstone as the villain is pretty generic and cut-and-dry, however that was a lot of movies in the MCU for about the first phase and a half: the focus has been more on the heroes for a long time, and this was definitely more about Natasha and Yelena's relationship, which they nailed. Winstone's Draykov is forgettable, but he's far from the only stock and standard MCU villain, so that's a criticism I'd raise towards the franchise as a whole (one which I think they've addressed: the MCU also has some great and memorable villains, too).The main tragedy is the way Taskmaster, a villain I've always thought had a cool angle, is used, or rather un-used, and then most likely cut out of future MCU movies and appearances, which is a shame. Making Taskmaster a victim of the main villain/circumstance, instead of a full-on villain, kind of took the teeth away from the character for me, and reminded me of the flat sort-of villain \"Ghost\" from Ant-Man and Wasp, who had a similar issue. You can write sympathetic villains, they can have understandable motivations, but I just feel making a villain someone's pawn or puppet and revealing them to be a victim isn't a story arc that's easy to do in a movie. That's something more cut-out for a TV show where you can really show the character changing over time with multiple appearances: my DBZ fans will recollect that Vegeta didn't do the heel-face turn overnight, that development takes time, or at least more than one movie.In general, if you miss the movies, love Marvel, and like Black Widow, and want to see a female-led superhero movie that's way better than Halley Berry's Catwoman, Elektra, or the 80's Supergirl movie (seriously, the major critics of female-led hero flicks need to remember how it used to be, when there's enough decent stuff out there starring hero ladies, then maybe we can raise the bar higher) and has some good laughs and decent action scenes, Black Widow is worth a watch, and of course, MCU fans have to stay for the post-credits that sets up for so much more story down the road.For being what you expect from the MCU, but not much more, I give Black Widow a 6.5 out of 10 (but IMDB doesn't let you do half-ratings) . Nostrovia."}, {"reviewer_name": "jaredkjacoby", "date": "11 July 2021", "text": "The story for Black Widow takes place after the events of Captain America: Civil War. Natasha Romanoff (Black Widow) is on the run after violating Sokovia Accords. When she flees to Norway, she encounters her sister, Yelena Belova. When they reunite, they have to escape other Black Widows who are trying to kill them as well as the Taskmaster who is after Natasha for carrying a substance called Red Dust. Natasha and Yelena are forced to face the past involving their parents as well as how they became to be the \"killers\" they are in the present day.This is the first Marvel movie that I have seen in theaters since Avengers Infinity War and it is also the first one that I saw on opening weekend. Not the best theater experience I ever had, but I do not think it affects my opinion of this film. I have always wondered why Black Widow never got her own film until today. She is such a cool character and she has the potential to have an interesting backstory and personality. She is also not as well known compared to the other Marvel characters. I only know Black Widow from the MCU. However, we finally have her solo film. How does Natasha fare in her solo story?Black Widow is ultimately a movie about Natasha's family. It is no normal family though. Natasha's family goes on an \"adventure\" that leads to her and her sister getting sent to Dreykov who puts them through training hell. Nat's story on how she became Black Widow is a lot more depressing and creepy than I thought it would be. It shows why she is one of the more serious and deadpan characters in the Avengers. It explores her inner demons well. The movie touches on the consequences of morally questionable actions. Nat has to confront her past and it is not pretty. She has to see her family again after not even looking for them for years. Worst of all, she has to deal with how she became Black Widow and what she did to the villain's daughter. This movie made me think about her as a person and not just a hero. It made her much more human and more of an anti-hero for better or worse.The tone of the film is pretty grim because of the themes it tackles, but there is plenty of comedy thanks to the family dynamic. One of my favorite scenes was Yelena making fun of Nat's \"heroic\" pose. That had me rolling. There is also some black comedy here to make sure the tone does not become too lighthearted. Overall, the story is good because it is a slow-burner that focuses on Nat's inner demons.Scarlett Johansson gives her best performance as Natasha to date. She is much more conflicted and emotive in the role, while still being the strong and stoic character she was in past Marvel films. She lets herself have a bit more humility with the character in both humorous and serious scenes. She even has a scene where she taunts the bad guy and it is great to watch. The movie along with Johansson's performance made me respect Natasha's character much more. You can tell she loves this character with all her heart. Florence Pugh as Yelena Belova is another standout. In fact, she is arguably the standout. She is so funny and charismatic in this role. Pugh is a natural and her character is incredibly charming while being really sympathetic. She is also the one to question Natasha's morality for good reasons. Pugh's chemistry with Johansson is spot on. They are so convincing that they act like sisters in real life. I would not be surprised if they are good friends in real life. Rachel Weisz and David Harbour play as their parents and they make for great characters as well. Harbour plays as such an over-the-top dad, that he feels like a parody of the bumbling dad archetype. Even in the climax, he is the only humorous part for better or worse.Then there are the villains. Both of them give me mixed thoughts. There is Dreykov who is easily one of the most despicable villains ever put in a Marvel film. The way he trains other women or even girls to become killing machines is creepy and disturbing and that is putting it lightly. He is also a smug coward who only gets into a fight when he is protected. He is only shown for a few minutes, but he has a big role and the actor playing as him makes the most out of his screen time to make him as loathsome as possible. Great job Ray Winstone! He is not the best villain, but he is fun to root against. The Taskmaster on the other hand is a horrible villain. I cannot say too much about them without spoiling the film, but the biggest problem (aside from comic book inaccuracies) is that the character feels like wasted potential. They could have been a great tragic villain, but they come off as too flat. The cast is great and most of the characters are good, but some of the villains could have been better.As for technical aspects, the biggest problem is the lighting, especially towards the beginning. There are some scenes with lighting that is too dim for the action scenes and in the opening scene as well. It gets better by the second act though. The costumes look solid, though Taskmaster's design looks generic. The action scenes are as good as you would expect from a Marvel film. My favorite sequence is the climactic battle where there is a free fall fight. It is a truly awesome sequence with great cinematography and slick fighting. The chase in Budapest is no slouch either. The scene where Natasha and Yelena break their father out of prison is great too. These three set pieces in particular are all beautifully-shot and fast-paced. These set pieces remind me why I like the action in MCU films so much. The first fight between Natasha and Taskmaster however is not so great. It is shot in the dark and it comes across as weak compared to the rest of the awesome action that comes later. Some of the cinematography is stunning, especially the scenes in the Red Room or in that whole ship. The musical score is one of the best in a Marvel film. It is pretty memorable and it adds to the tension in the film.Black Widow is a solid entry to the MCU. While it is far from the best Marvel film, it is a movie that fleshes out Natasha's flaws, provides solid action and brings an awesome family together. It also does a good job with its themes of family and morality. It makes you wonder how heroic Nat is, but the script succeeds in making her sympathetic. It was nice seeing a Marvel movie in theaters again and I hope that this new wave of Marvel films continue to deliver. This was a nice sendoff to a great MCU character.Stay through the credits! Trust me, it is a good one."}, {"reviewer_name": "drs-09434", "date": "11 July 2021", "text": "I really wanted to like this flick.

This is a character who should have been explored sometime before, you know, she died...The problem is that all tension is undone by the fact that you know what happens next. The villains don't work because you know they aren't around for infinity war and our protagonists are. The whole family element is undone by the fact that they weren't given a single line of dialogue at any appearance in Natasha's life and death. I'm sorry, but a vest just doesn't do that.Other than that its standard marvel fair. Not bad, not good, just forgettable, like iron man 2. Performances are great, casting is great, but the actors are done a disservice by having nothing to do and no greater significance. None more so than Olga Kurylenko, who is in this movie for almost no reason and whose presence represents taking a steaming dump on who Taskmaster actually is.To be clear, the problem isn't her, it's what they've done to the character. Taskmaster is an interesting villain with unique abilities and he has been robbed of all that here and is nothing more than a Soviet Union knock off of Tony Starks combat adaptation program seen in civil war.The only purpose of this movie is Yelena and while I love Florence Pugh, it wasn't worth it."}, {"reviewer_name": "lucaslw-93145", "date": "11 July 2021", "text": "Solid 7/10 overall, but starts off a 8/10.The movie had a very strong start, starting with a narratively compelling opening sequence and quickly developing into a series of well-choreographed action set pieces.From there, and about halfway into the movie, It feels like as more moving pieces started coming into play the script didn't really know what to do with itself and failed to properly juggle or balance all the different elements. The pace slowed as layers of backstory were dialogued and the attempt to layer in the broken-family healing motif fell pretty flat.What's more is that as the plot got more complicated, so too did the action. Nearing the 3rd act of the film, all the action involved Michael Bay levels of explosions, car crashes that even Captain America would struggle to survive, and Avenger's level threats that felt out of scope for a Black Widow movie. There's also a couple of weird \"solutions\" that are casually glossed over (you can sever a nerve by banging your head on a desk? What?) In all, the action sequences in act 2 and 3 were too high stakes and over-the-top to feel in place for the movie and break the immersive feeling that the crew worked hard to put in place during the first act.Also wasn't blown away by the use of Taskmaster in this movie, felt like a weak origin story with a pretty mediocre ending. Cool fight sequences though, good inclusion of iconic fight choreo from Black Panther, Winter Soldier, Hawkeye, Cpt America, etc.Lastly, this movie continues the tradition of sacrificial set pieces with table stakes where the ending has to be happy. Yelena destroys a rotor and gets flung off in an explosion that would literally kill any non-super. Just have her jump off before it explodes, make the explosion smaller, or have that be a traditional sacrifice for her and her sisters' pain.

Good guys. Coming out and and instantly saying you're underpaid (She got 25 million for this movie), when other male actors don't get that is ridiculous.We're living in this world now where instead of focusing on great stories and good characters, it's all about politics and ideology. Insulting half of your fan base before the movie starts off isn't going to sit well as that isn't inclusive at all.It didn't hit a home run, or come close to what we've seen before.

Two characters; the clumsy innocent moments of David Harbour steals the movie as the lovable Alexei / Red Soldier (or whatever name his character was); a very strong but not very intelligent fake father.On a more cynical but equally effective note Florence Pugh / Yelena as the fake sister, make you laugh every time she says something. Both are really the heart and soul of the movie even when they are not doing jokes.I really had to admire Scarlet (also executive producer) to take a back step and let these two characters shine. She gives a decent performance but her character (sexy and violent) requires a more adult oriented movie than a PG 13 one.Second the action; even when some scenes are not that spectacular; the pace is always fast so it never gets boring.About the bad things; the clich\u00e9s. Hollywood needs to stop with that.I am person of faith but people DO NOT CHANGE IN FIVE MINUTES. Bad guys (or women) can become repented but not that fast.Even with his mind managed; Antonia / Taskmaster will not forgive that easy the person who tried to kill her and destroyed her face.

At the time of writing, it's the newest entry in the MCU, but feels like one that should have been made 5 years ago. It's a spy thriller, but with twists and turns that can be seen from a mile away. It's meant to finally put the spotlight on Johansson's Black Widow, but her character takes a back seat whenever Florence Pugh or David Harbour come on screen...Unfortunately there's not much to offer here in terms of story, thanks in large part to the fact that we know how Natasha's journey plays out in previous films. After the exciting prologue, the 1st act of the movie is a bit forgettable and what happens in the 2nd and 3rd doesn't feel like it has much impact. We're told how bad the bad guy is, but the writers never provide a sense of urgency or give the audience a demonstration of why he needs to be stopped (aside from, you know, him being a bad guy). On top of that, and without spoilers, the most interesting nugget of story is handled as contextual dialogue between two characters, where this particular beat would have been great to actually see on screen. With all this in mind, by the end it left me feeling like there was so much wasted potential here for a truly great spy thriller.Speaking of \"thrills\", it's not an MCU movie without big 'ol action scenes. The best set pieces here, came in the form of impressively choreographed, Bourne-inspired, \"street level\" brawls. They felt hard hitting (pun intended) and visceral. Ironically though, the bigger the scope gets later in the film, the less impressed I was. A demonstration that more doesn't always equal better.Aside from the wanting plot, twists and 'splosions, the movie succeeds in its characterisation, particularly with MCU newcomers, Yelena Belova (Florence Pugh) and Alexei (David Harbour). These two steal the show and provide a much needed boost of energy and heart to an otherwise artificial experience. That's not to say Scar Jo doesn't bring her A-game: she goes above and beyond what she was given to work with, but at times it feels like an injustice that her character is written as the one to reel in the more quirky and exciting characters, and always in control of the situation - never quite letting the audience buy into any kind of \"struggle\" the protagonist is facing.All in all, the \"quieter\" moments in between set pieces is really where the movie shines and entertains the most.

They play brilliantly as family members and how can we forget Scarlett Johansson as Black Widow.Let's talk about the villain, I guess Taskmaster is just there to copy other avengers moves. Ray Winstone is pretty good but he has a short role . The ending is sad and the post credit scene is exciting and teases the mind blowing future of marvel.

Questions I have: What's with the over the top action scenes that look like something from Fast and Furious? Natasha will never die when she can simply jump out of any window and always find a railing grab. Or hang from a helicopter and pluck people with seemingly super-human strength.If this weren't a Marvel movie (which it doesn't need to be since it does nothing to expand the overall MCU story), I'd probably give it a 3 or 4."}, {"reviewer_name": "raiankader", "date": "10 July 2021", "text": "This movie taught me to lower my expactations as much as possible.It was a good movie, entertaining, funny in some ways, would I watch it again? No, I wouldn't.The action in this movie was great, the costumes were perfect, and the plot twists were exciting.Over-all the movie needed a little more wow factor, it was somewhat underwhelming considering it took Marvel 10 years to give Black Widow her solo movie.Pugh and Johansson had amazing chemistry, hope to see them together again."}, {"reviewer_name": "hasony-88910", "date": "10 July 2021", "text": "A rather beautiful movie, even if it contains high fictional scenes and sometimes exceeded imagination, but it is worth watching. Thank you."}, {"reviewer_name": "blende", "date": "10 July 2021", "text": "The first half of the movie feels like a Marvel Film with nice character development, smart dialogue, and creative and exciting action sequences, especially the motorcycle sequences.The second half of the movie feels like a slick WWE production where the action sequences become routine and the dialogue and convenient plot devices serve as nothing more than a generic propulsion system for the loud climax.All in all I did enjoy Black Widow although it was slightly disappointing to see a legendary actor like Ray Winstone fall in and out of a Russian accent like Keanu Reeves attempting a British accent.The \"severing\" of the olfactory nerve was just silly and even more ridiculous when Natasha simply realigns her nose to fix it.Considering the CGI standard set in Infinity War and Endgame, I was shocked to see that some of the CGI was poorly executed, Natasha's auto wreck on the bridge is a prime example.Surprisingly, Natasha's intelligence as a super spy and leader of the avengers is sacrificed throughout the film and she consistently makes silly decisions that only serve to unnecessarily prolong action sequences. Why not create exciting action sequences that capitalize on her skills and problem solving rather than minimize her character's capabilities and reputation.One last thought, as many times as the word \"avengers\" is mentioned throughout the film, it almost felt like a psychological writing technique to ensure the audience is still programmed to be Marvel loyal. Either that or they felt it was a cheap way to remind viewers that this is a Marvel film.Overall enjoyable even if it became a loud heartless mess at the climax."}, {"reviewer_name": "jameso8-1", "date": "10 July 2021", "text": "I quite enjoyed this, the four family actors all seemed to bounce off each other well, Scarlett Johansson was outshone by the rest though especially Florence Pugh and David Harbour. I do agree that the villain didn't have a big enough part in it, maybe after casting Ray Winstone they realised they made a mistake so gave him as little screen time as possible, nothing against him just didn't suit the role imo.

I loved all the lead characters in this - Florence Pugh (as Yelena) is amazing as always; David Harbour (as Alexei) provides great comic relief; Rachel Weisz (as Melina) continues kicking arse as she did a couple of decades ago. Scarlett Johansson leads the pack here, in a stellar show that leads us to believe how she sacrificed herself in Endgame. The screenplay (by Eric Pearson) is packed with the right doses of situational humour, expensive set-pieces, and a worthwhile plot. On one hand, it feels as if it shouldn't have taken so many years for Natasha's standalone adventure, after watching the film. On the other, it also feels like it came out in the right decade when feminist movements are globally peaking.Especially in Pugh and Harbour, director Cate Shortland finds characters worth investing time, energy, and screenspace in. Sisterhood is used as a powerful storytelling device here - it helps establish the emotions and even a few running gags. The scene where Yelena mocks Natasha's signature poses was a scream. The same goes for the scene where Alexei tries to make Yelena feel better after an uncomfortable revelation during their family reunion. The good thing is that Cate Shortland's vision fits like a glove within the MCU, even when it is devoid of Avenger cameos or Easter eggs. She devotes sufficient time to the expository scenes between set pieces, gradually building effective connections between the film's protagonists.What I found unnecessary is Shortland's hand-holding of the audience when it comes to the twists. And just like Mandarin in Iron Man 3, TaskMaster (Olga Kurylenko) feels very underutilized as an antagonist. The CGI, for a $200 mn budget, looks stunning for the most part, except in a few shots where it looks tacky. Even with said issues, Black Widow ends on an action-packed, emotional high. As a star, Johansson clearly knows when to play lead and when to let others around her shine and have their moments. I look forward to seeing Pugh become a key figure in the next phase of the MCU. She's just that damn good and deserves a solo film of her own in the near future!"}, {"reviewer_name": "avats-01185", "date": "10 July 2021", "text": "The story was great I liked it but they couldn't put the things together well.

When approaching a character with no super powers but still aiming to make a large action film you have to aim high but fall short.Black Widow is set between Civil War and Infinity War and does a great job of setting itself in between those events but it does feel like a filler film and not Natasha's Swan Song. If this had been released chronologically it would have fared far better going on Romanov's journey without knowing where it ends. I personally would have preferred her solo outing to show us what really happened in Budapest rather than just more alluring comments to her defection. Had this film been the origin of Barton and Natasha's relationship then that would have given more heft to her death in Endgame other than introducing the family that are never seen or heard from again.Where I would have hoped for James Bond meets Black Widow, this film felt like Mission Impossible meets MCU - the exaggerated action and set pieces of international espionage are fun but the plot isn't the most adventurous. Action scenes are thick and fast and well choreographed and the majority of the main cast pull off great performances.The Taskmaster twist I saw coming a third of the way through the movie and felt he was a character that was greatly let down - the comics version can go toe-to-toe with Captain America but only a couple of decent sequences let this shell of a character see any screen time. Red Guardian also suffered from under use - the soviet super soldier has no explanation of how he came to be or what his past really entails other than boastful stories of a washed up hero.Black Widow's delay has not helped. The Disney+ trio of WandaVision, Falcon and the Winter Soldier and Loki have done some amazing work moving the MCU and it's characters forward that to then drop a prequel and move backwards always comes with risks of telling a chapter that has to fit into the established canon and not create its own."}, {"reviewer_name": "kolendacourtney", "date": "10 July 2021", "text": "The action scenes were cool (except for a few parts where the heros should have clearly died even in mcu universe and they were fine) and David harbour was great as usual but it was just an \"ehh\" kind of movie."}, {"reviewer_name": "michaelshrivell", "date": "10 July 2021", "text": "So for our first trip to the cinema in over a year and a half, my son's and I were looking forward to seeing the MCU back on the big screen and seeing Black Widow. Sadly I never thought I would say this as a massive die hard marvel fan but this was the most boring and pointless MCU film to date. The first hour was extremely boring and this film added nothing new to the MCU. Having established its time frame, we knew the ending before it even got going and that added to it being even more boring and predictable. Evan the action scenes were boring and predictable and nothing new to add to the experience. On the plus was nice seeing william HURT again and made us really want him back chasing the hulk. This may have been better coming out a few years ago, say maybe before infinity war but not now. Sorry marvel but this film is the weakest of the MCU and maybe a few years to late to arrive."}, {"reviewer_name": "poseidon-233", "date": "9 July 2021", "text": "Okay uhm, we started great but then something happened and we just got to the point where there was too little time to fit in the final conclusion to the movie. I like the Black Widow and I enjoyed the backstorie but they could have shown a bit more of her in the Red Room and how she escaped from it. They only tell you that she tried to kill the creator of the Red Room and that he is still alive and they need to go finally stop him. That is your entire plot for the movie, there is no focus on the villian until the end and no fear when you see him. He didn't appear as a villian but rahter a dying old man wanting to create a army.I enjoyed the sisters fighting alongside each other but when Red Gaurdian entered the enjoyment just went away. Red Gaurdian delivered no input into the movie, all he did was give them the location of their \"mother\" ,and he lost against Task Master. Thats all he did, nothing else that contributed to the story. A waste.I was really dissappointed when I saw who Task Master actually was and that in the end she is saved as well. They changed the gender of a perfect character to fit into a okay movie. The character could have had so much more potential. They could have made him the son of the villian and instead Natasha and her sister had to fight together to defeat him, and that he was the main villain all along.It makes me scared to think how Marvel movies are changing now and that they are moving away from the actual stories but rather changing them to fit in with our world today."}, {"reviewer_name": "nvmensah", "date": "9 July 2021", "text": "I was very excited for black widow, but that hype slowly died out as the movie became delayed time after time.

Trying to prove she's worthy of the title she shares with literal gods, it relies in unrestrained bombastic action, full things blowing up or crashing (using a not so good cgi), while the old good hand to hand combat one would come to expect from this movie is both brief and lacking.In the narrative department the movie gives you scenes full of emotional dialogue (along with jokes and exposition is the only type of dialogue I've found) with no build up to back it up. Why should anyone care about or even believe this \"family\" when they've only seen it for two minutes before cutting to a car chase.These wounds just deepen with a soundtrack who knows nothing of restraint, selling scenes with regular dialogue as pivotal moments or killing the tension in otherwise good action scenes that sound the same at the beginnig, when nothing has happened yet, and at the end, when everything's going down.Wrapping up with the negatives, taksmaster is extremely underused (I don't really mind changes from it's comicbook counterpart), and the movie would benefit greatly from cutting entirely the Morocco scene (too many reasons to comment here). And don't get me started on the comments, jokes and references aimed specifically for the audience, for you to feel good because \"you got it\", taking you out of the story.To end in a positive note; Johansson, Harbour and Pugh give tremendous charisma to their characters. Red guardian's character is BRILLIANTLY constructed through subtle action and not exposition, even if he migth be too much of a comic relief for some. The movie has some really good moments."}, {"reviewer_name": "chrisfilmpresents", "date": "9 July 2021", "text": "The first 1/3 of the film was quite great and intense. Then it went down real quick...it could have been written better. What I expect is more origin story of Natasha, how she became who she is now. How Barton helped her and what exactly happened in Budapest, since they kept bringing up in previous films. Yet....it was just a quick memory of a mission and that's all. What a shame and what a waste. The fighting scene was good, just another shame that we couldn't see more fighting scenes from Taskmaster. She barely showed up, pretty much all her fighting scenes were seen already in the trailer.....really a huge disappointment....it could have been much better if they can just stick to Natasha's origin story rather than forcing to build a story between Civil War and Infinity War."}, {"reviewer_name": "Johnny-the-Film-Sentinel-2187", "date": "9 July 2021", "text": "**There be spoilers ahead**Black Widow is the MCU's first hard 'interquel': as in it takes place firmly between Civil War and Infinity War, so it's a prequel-sequel kind of. We know what happens to Black Widow in Avengers Endgame, but hey: the more milk the merrier the spoils of Disney's MARVEL cash cow I guess.It's an entertaining film that is just fancy backstory for a character whom we KNOW is bound to die later in the timeline, so plot-armour is used in SPADES for Black Widow here; she survives countless near-death experiences, but her stormtrooper-accurate foes fail to get so much as a bullet-wound on her fingers. The supporting cast are all fine, Scar-Jo is obviously the star who keeps the whole thing together in her iconic catsuit, and she's the kind of Bond girl who would easily save James' bacon from Blofeld.Of course this film being a prequel begs the question: why didn't anyone notice the Red Room 'fortress' in the sky before now? It wasn't officially government-protected like S. H. I. E. L. D. was in The Winter Soldier (evil conspiracy from inside the primary circle of American influence) so how come Ultron didn't know about it? Was there a VPN to scramble its whereabouts? And the Russians had the Super Soldier serum duplicated via David Harbour's Russian-Captain-America archetype? Oh well: the plot plays out in the way you expect it to in a MARVEL Studios film; establishing backstory, have characters face inciting incident, and finally overcoming their own hubris to save the day (and in turn, the world).It doesn't have the exact same story beats of Thor: Ragnarok or Captain Marvel's repressed-heroes-discovering-their-inner-power-at-the-climax arcs, but rather it borrows from this film's spiritual prequel, Captain America: The Winter Soldier in terms of a grander conspiracy that's resolved all too easily during the climax.The action's punchy, the characters charming and direction lively, but the script could have had more polish to it in terms of the in-world logic established by the MCU's earlier movies being self-aware in terms of continuity.Black Widow: another MARVEL movie that gets its job done, if not too much else beyond that. 3.5/5 stars.
