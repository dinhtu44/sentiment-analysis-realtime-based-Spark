[{"reviewer_name": "ThomDerd", "date": "3 May 2021", "text": "Marvel has spoiled us fans in the past. But this series is just not as good. Its not because of politics or of political correctness or of racial mentions; its because of the PLOT.Which kinda sucks. Inconsistent and at many times just pointless, the plot seems uninspired and forced, in order to make this series' story move forward.Here's a few: What exactly was Carly's main motivation? What makes the GRC so bad for Carly? Why don't they work more on the idea of the shield as a mantle? That could have been a great opportunity here.Why get into the power broker story arc in the first place and not further develop it?And why spend so much time in the political issues? Is that because the script is just non-existant? Maybe...\nThe dialogue at times is also incredibly stupid...which makes me wonder about the way marvel/disney approach their audience nowadays.Wandavision was not perfect but it was smart and well made with good dialogue and world building. But this one is more closer to a messy, character-lacking and backstory-missing series.Now why 6,5? 1-The action sequences are good and the start is impressive. Also there is a few more action sequences further on which are worth it. 2-Stan and Mackie are good action actors and look alright on screen, so its fun watching them and their chemistry is ok. 3-because i m a fan like most people here and i still like watching these stories and I appreciate the effort needed to get these done.I would just like this one to be better...\n6,5/10 for the action."}, {"reviewer_name": "mark-carpenter13", "date": "25 April 2021", "text": "Certainly had entertaining moments, but the writing was like a patchwork of scenes strung together with random scraps of yarn.

Yes. Did that annoy me? Yes. But I can typically look past that and still enjoy the show or film, so that actually has very little to do with my low score here. I thought it started out strong but after finishing the last episode, I have no idea why winter soldier is even in the title, because he had very little\nto do with anything. Anything they set up for Bucky in the first few episodes were barely skimmed over by the end. What was the point?! This was all about setting up future Captain America movies, and not done well at all. The ending was so extremely cheesey that I didn't even want to finish the last 5 minutes of it. All I know is that this is not the same marvel that's been pumping out awesome movies for the last 10+ years. At least WandaVision had heart and soul and a great villain... this had none of that.

It's just vauge social commentary about displaced people or something? She complains constantly about how unfair everything is and why her violence is justified. I guess this is Disney's idea\nof an Anti-hero. It's not working.

Falcon and Winter's relationship feels shallow and forced which leaves the impression that the characters are shallow. MCU has built complex characters with emotional intelligence throughout all their movies, and this feels like an outlier. Having little soul, the story is mostly boring. The only interesting parts are the non-superhero scenes that talk to racial tensions. Those scenes have depth and realistic context which, in other MCU movies exists throughout the entire story and action scenes. In this story, depth is slid in between plot points like an afterthought. I have loved every MCU movie and WandaVision, but this one doesn't carry the energy of the others.

Bucky seems a much more interesting character but he fails to deliver big time. Staring is not acting.And Falcon.. he can't get help for his sister yet he is flying around the globe answering to no one?I'm shelving this one until I've got nothing else to watch.Ps. The story is already so predictable I want to cry from making the mistake of watching yet another predictable TV show. Yes I can't write better than them but I don't have to.

The visual effects are stunning, the chemistry between Bucky and Falcon is pretty nice to see and the fight scenes are on point.I really like to see more of Bucky and his internal struggles. He is such a badass and interesting character. Also the fight scenes from Bucky are so good that I had to watch them on repeat later on youtube.Now what ruins the show is the constant intention to smack us in the face with politics. I agree and support the movements but I prefer not to be constantly reminded of all that. I don't need all the TV to be a politically correct advertisement and statement from Disney. I am ok for some subliminar messages but every episode talking about it and centring everything around that is just annoying and takes away from the story. Also the constant dialog about the Black Lives mater movement seemed so cringe. The actors themselves seem to think it to be unnatural and strange. You could literally hear in their voice how unnatural it was for them to say the lines.For me it ruined the TV show."}, {"reviewer_name": "oliverlines", "date": "2 May 2021", "text": "Despite the fairly low rating I've given it, the show isn't always too bad. It has some awesome action scenes, some great dialogue, and John Walker is a genuinely great character. Plus Zemo was the standout character but not in it enough.The main problems are that the 'villain' sucks, the Winter Soldier is nothing more than a sideshow, and it's too political. The 'villain', used very loosely, is some angsty teenager who just goes around killing people for no real reason.Bucky is pretty much a pointless character. He does essentially nothing that actually contributes to the overriding plot of the series, a series which only exists to make Sam the new Captain America.Whilst we're (not) on it, Sharon's story arc makes absolutely no sense at all. She was a CIA agent last we saw, and now suddenly she's committing treason? It's literally never explained why she did this. She was clearly shoehorned in because they wanted to include an established character.Finally, yes comic books have always included politics blah blah blah, that's not my issue. My issue is that everyone is so obsessed with Sam being black and therefore he cannot possibly be Captain America?! Literally the only character in the entire show who says that is Isaiah, who tells Sam that \"no self-respecting black man would ever want to be Captain America.\" That is such a ridiculous, tribalistic piece of dialogue and it blows my mind that it wasn't left on the cutting room floor. It makes literally no sense, especially considering Fury was head of one of America's top spy organisations and Rhodey is one of the Air Force's most decorated Colonels. Almost like all black people aren't a hive mind, huh?Ultimately, the show had its moments but the good stuff all came inside the first three episodes and it really crawled to a self-fellating finish. It would've been much better served as a two-hour movie instead of what was essentially a five-hour movie.

It could have been the Dark Knight of the MCU. Instead it turned into a smoking pile of crap. The first three episodes introduced us to complex characters, and very intricate plot. Instead of embracing complexity, the show runners dumbed it down so much, that it was pure cringe to watch. Zemo could've played a bigger role in the finale, but he didn't. He was arrested by Wakandans. John Walker could've played a bigger role as an antagonist in the finale. But he didn't. He was just there. The flag smashers could've been an interesting moral dilemma. They weren't. While all the characters supposedly agreed with their goal, they used a bomb once so they became the enemy.

The captain america was a character in the marvel universe, not some title that needs to be passed on.

If they really want to cash in on the captain america they'll need to bring Chris back, there is no other way around, bring him back from the moon :) The show had poor choice of cast from Karli to the senator, seems like they had some budget issues. Julia, though tried, but wasn't convincing enough, maybe needed some more of a back story or dramatic intro. Also, the show was really slow, coupled with bad script and the dialogues and the subpar acting, it really isn't the marvel level show. It had more talk time than action time, turning into the oprah winfrey show for a moment. The political overtones overshadowed the entertainment side of the show. The Winter Soldier was the only thing that was marvel about the show. He was the only one who did justice to his character and played it well. He still remains the enigmatic character that won praise in earlier movies and it was good see him getting closure on his past.

There were a lot of them left dangling and so they should be wrapped up. (Zemo, Other Winter Soldiers)\nI like they are shedding light on forgotten Avengers like Winter Soldier and Falcon. It was good when they did that in Wandavision and it is important to remember supporting charactersNow, for my least favorite/favorite part of a review: the cons(I will try to be quick as I am fond of this show and while it has flaws my low rating will get higher)It is taking a long time to build up. For Wanda Vision it worked well, but for such a quick paced show it needs to get somewhere faster\nWe kind of skipped over Sam's family issues and Bucky's trauma in favor of more action. While I like action, those were important story elements.There are too many names to keep up with and it isn't explained well what is going on. That I think they could have done better.Final thoughts:It is too early to review this show. I am leaving my review so far and intend to update it, so most of the issues will probably get addressed.

I like that we see more drama and sorrow with Sam Wilson and Anthony Mackie has done awesome at exploring that. Sebastian Stan once again shows how great he is at expressing without words. The first scene in this newest episode was both heartbreaking and beautiful and I too my hat to him.I'm looking forward to the rest of the season and I am just confused by the reaction on here. The first episode was slow, but it has picked up rather quickly. And you cannot compare to Wandavision!

As a result, the original characters stop being so pathetic and the plot goes from nonsense to somewhat watchable. However, my favorite part is this \"New Captain America\" who acts as a true capitalistic character in a capitalistic system. The machine needs a cog and no matter how sentimental or heartless it is, the memory of the old cog, Steve Rogers, will be forgotten. His cockiness, self-confidence and personal drive feel refreshing as he brings something new to Marvel.I wouldn't say you need to watch this series as it feels like a hollow cylinder stuffed with pretentiousness that acts as a filler without adding value to the big picture. From the protagonists and antagonists to the plot itself along with all the preaching, everything just feels so fake and soulless. They try to add substance and meaning to the plot but they overstuff it with political agenda and just can't seem to make it look authentic.

Were the racial commentary to be excised the show would be stronger, but watching it many will come to the conclusion that Disney places more value on the radical left propaganda than anything else.Consequently you're given characters that aren't allowed to be defined as individuals; everything must be viewed in the context of race.

Sounds a lot like RT deleting bad reviews doesn't it?It's hard to collect together how astonishingly bad this is. I could only make it through two episodes and that was all I needed to see how utterly lame it was.The script and writing is so bad, it's like it is written in crayon by a committee of PC executives. They could have saved the money from the empty and tension free opening action scene and actually invested it in the script.All of the lines are so exposition heavy and so blatantly telegraphed that it is written in a way that people don't actually talk. And the wokeism, it is never ending and delivered with the subtlety of a Mjolnir hammer strike.Right off the bat, Sam is giving a speech where he has to say '\"in honour of the women and men\". That isn't how you say it, just as you wouldn't say \"good evening Gentlemen and Ladies\". It's so obvious what they are trying to do and it jars because it's reminding you that literally every single line of dialogue has been passed through the PC filter.The wokeness continues when Sam and Buck visit a predominantly black neighbourhood but then the cops turn up and Sam is hassled for ID and asked whether he is bothering Bucky. It is literally so transparent what they are trying to say and comment on, that they might as well be holding up massive que cards.So they've wheeled out some handy new super serum and given it to a bunch of Portland Antifa who wants to break down authority and be given free stuff.If you remember, the serum is meant to magnify what is inside the person making someone strong even stronger or evil even more evil. But of course, it apparently also has the ability to make the weediest girl way stronger than anyone else. Because, you know, woman and all that.The action scenes have no consequences. People get hurt or die depending on whether the writer wants them to rather than the 'rules' of the world they have created. A super soldier stamps on a guy's face that would pop anyone's head and seemingly he's fine. Are non-serum people now equally robust or only when the tiresomely woke writer decides.But the contradictions and hypocrisy pervade the whole show. I mean, apparently Chris Evans was upset at Johnny killing someone. Seemingly Chris' Cap had no problems kicking those Hydra guys out of the plane in The First Avenger. Are those deaths okay?But what am I saying. The world has moved on now. White guys are bad and need to be detoxified. Oh and guys are bad and they need to be detoxified as well. Hence Bucky seemingly becomes the butt of literally every single joke.In the end you just feel that Marvel are single handily trying to destroy what they spent so long crafting. I mean everyone that they killed off in Infinity War to shock the audience into the seriousness of the situation is coming back thanks to, you know, the multiverse and stuff.So if you try to watch Infinity War again, you realise it's pointless because everything that happens in it is negated, overlooked, ignored or turned into idiots in Endgame. To that extent, Endgame made Infinity War unwatchable.But at least it couldn't affect the superb Winter Soldier and Civil War. At least they couldn't be corrupted could they? Of course they can. Just like how the moronic last Star Wars trilogy managed to reach back to corrupt and negate Vader's sacrifice in ROTJ, so this idiotic series manages to tarnish those two films as you see what cretinous, virtuous and banal characters they have turned those characters into.Marvel's ability to destroy itself really is a sight to behold. In Endgame they had to mock one of Caps famous lines by poking fun at something delivered with genuine sincerity at the end of Civil War. At the time, I questioned how people who really love Cap could treat his character with such contempt.This show perfectly highlights the attitude that is eating away at Marvel. Like a model who succumbs to a 'little bit' of plastic surgery, they just can't stop tinkering, trying to make it better, trying to make it more relevant, more woke. And what they end up with is this hideous bloated embarrassment of a show that is a million miles away from the simple wholesomeness that they started with.I said after Endgame, and the other two incredibly lame releases of that year, that the death knell was out for the MCU. This proves how quickly that death spiral is gaining momentum."}, {"reviewer_name": "skippdarby", "date": "26 April 2021", "text": "If this preachy, woke, politically correct, identity political show is the direction Marvel is heading, well, good luck with that.

It gives so much more development behind Bucky and Sam, the former being perhaps my favorite character currently in the MCU. All the character performances were commendable.In addition to the characters, the action sequences were superb! (Though they were far and few between.) There is no complaints here. I appreciate the character development of Sam Wilson as he takes the mantle of Captain America (my favorite super hero of all time.)HOWEVER, the political agenda in this series could not be more prominent. It feels like you're watching an extended ad for a woke movement or BLM. Though I am not against these movements, I would have appreciated it if it wasn't the prominent feature of this series. If I had to describe it in one sentence, it would be, \"a woke campaign with a little action that helps you love Bucky more.\"Once again, I am not against those movements and I know that the issues expressed in this series have very real counterparts. As a series if I had watched it in 2019, I would have appreciated it much more. But the timing of this series, in conjunction with its content, made it hard to watch as a source of entertainment and fantastic storytelling. It is much more a political agenda driven ad than a MCU series."}, {"reviewer_name": "paul_obe", "date": "10 April 2021", "text": "Hollywood .... nothing new here ... same as the other comic book movies that have come out after end game ... let it dry up !

The delivery of every single line was beyond wooden, it was like watching a primary school play and a child simply standing on stage and speaking their lines. I could not take her seriously as a villain as I could barely believe she was an actress. How this girl got the role I will never know and how their are not more people discussing this baffles me. This also gives me hope that I could now become a Marvel actress, with zero acting experience. I predicted her death would be as wooden as her whole role, but I was glad to see her go.

Mind-numbingly intricate character development, nonsensical political struggle, and TV filler. We don't merely see superheroes and villains knock each other around, we see them walking to the fighting destinations and talking incessantly to delay those confrontations. The same arguments replayed over several different episodes. I didn't want to watch Sam and Bucky fix a boat, or Sam apply for a bank loan, or Bucky talk in circles with a shrink. And, I doubt the post-blip politics of a war on terror over national borders or whatever could be more vaguely inconsequential. Sam's speech at the end was atrociously artificial--a supposedly moving speech to rally the common folk as engineered by Disney executives. The generic fanaticism of the Flag Smashers even worse.Even as movies released theatrically, the MCU has been a serial--a 20-plus-and-counting episodic series on bigger screens and with bigger budgets. Not necessarily a bad thing I think. After all, the first comic-book superhero movies were serials released in theatres: \"Adventures of Captain Marvel\" (1941) and the Fleischer Studios \"Superman\" (1941 and thereafter) cartoon series. When the Superman and Batman feature-length blockbusters came in the 1970s and 1980s, they too became part of multi-film franchises. Imagine if instead of six episodes released one per week--seemingly just enough time for us to forget the last episode was the same thing--this were split into two or three theatrically-released movies instead. In that spirit, it's the worst MCU episode since \"The Incredible Hulk\" (2008).\"The Falcon and the Winter Soldier\" is all the more disappointing because it comes on the heels of the cleverly-reflexive \"WandaVision\" (2021). That's a show that understands and exploits its medium instead of suffering from it. A TV series about the magic of creating them. Even Wanda's grief-stricken retreat into nostalgia works better on the level of character interest. It's a show that ingeniously ended with shapeshifting in an empty theatre. Here, we're just supposed to get excited by a cameo from an actress who reminds us of a better TV series, I guess.

I think we were all so hopeful because we are so invested in Sam and Bucky, and the charm and gravitas of these two leads is undeniable. So while I still adore the primary actors and always will, and I appreciate how just their presence is making the show watchable, the series as a whole is what I consider to be a failure because they've gone into it without any real sense of direction or competent scripting. There are some sweet moments however, I found the first episode to be one of the best, and felt it may yet overcome the lack of story, but no, they went down the endlessly preaching road, the endlessly standing around talking about feelings road, which really is a cheap way of getting out of having a plot. The primary baddie, while to my eyes a very striking and beautiful young woman, is utterly tedious as a character. I can't count how many times I was bored to sobs and almost turned it off, most often when she was talking or doing anything at all really. Next time I think Marvel will have to take better care with their combination of writing and casting their bad guys. So often a superhero film bases much of its success on the gravitas of the baddie, and there is ZERO gravitas here. I like Zemo, I like Sam's sister, but without a real plot nearly every great actor here is wasted. Marvel also needs to consider - if we are going to preach politics non-stop, are we preaching to the choir? Preaching to the choir is boring for everybody. Most Marvel fans (I find) are already anti-racism/anti-evil, so why spend every single minute preaching our beliefs back at us? We're already on board with a black Cap, so just give us a rollicking adventure already! This is why Superheroes are so popular in the first place - the momentum of adventure! Such a waste of talent. Please, please Marvel, don't repeat the mistake in future. Go back to your roots, and let the good script and the story carry the day!

Another thing I liked was how they tackled real world problems. I think the way they wrote the story around Isaiah Bradley was just perfect. The action scenes in this show were also really cool. Lastly, I also liked how we got to see a little bit of Sam's life. We got to see where he grew up, his sister, and his two nephews. I really liked that character development. Some more character development we got was the Bucky and Ayo scene in Wakanda. I thought it was well done. Even thought it had its pros, this show also had its cons. It was boring at times. The premier, and episode 5 I felt like they took forever, they were almost useless to the plot, and they could have easily cut the time in half. Another thing was the plot. I really don't think it does Steve Rodgers justice having a seemingly unstable man hold the shield, then kill someone. I also didn't really think this plot was realistic with so many people believing in what Karli does even though it is borderline terrorism.In the end, this show turned out to be good, but it wasn't the best Marvel production.

He's helped save half the universe's population and works for the government and you're telling me he doesnt get paid or can't afford to buy anything??!!Furthermore the villain was awful!! So unforgettable and very irritating! They don't explain how on earth a young woman who used to be a refugee or support worker got her hands on a batch of Super Soldier serum and where exactly did she learn the technological skills or the skills to take down the government. And if I hear Mama Donya again, I'm gna be raging, felt like banging my head against a wall whenever she mentioned Mama Donya.In one episode, a Super Soldier says he'll stay behind to buy the group more time. And he literally runs into open fire and died instantly without even touching a cop. What was the point??!!! Should have just got on the plan with the rest of them. And it shows that Super Soldiers are not close to being invincible.Also, they focused too much on political and making this about race and identify, nothing wrong with that but it did drag onnn alot at times.Overall would have liked a more compelling villain and faster paced story."}, {"reviewer_name": "laubepiotr", "date": "19 March 2021", "text": "At least worth to spend the initial 10 minutes to enjoy the action sequence with Falcon.

All in all just really poor filmmaking, and surprising considering that the Marvel formula is so well developed by now that any reasonably competent director could have made content along those lines. This series is also irritatingly permeated by politics (#metoo and BLM), and it's just done in such a crude and idiotic manner that any relevance or emotive power is lost.Looks like a very poor choice of director, and writing something that was incoherent and uninteresting from the very beginning. Superhero stories need great villains, which this utterly lacks as well. I'm just surprised that a producer as talented and capable as Feige let this happen, total failure to deliver on Marvel's basic promise of comic book superhero storytelling.

Such a shame after WandaVision had characters of all colors and ethnicities and it wasn't made an issue of. We enjoyed their character because of who they were not because of the color of their skin.It's a shame that a lot of people are left unhappy because Marvel Studios took this line.Disney only removed The Song Of The South because of the outcry from people who have probably never seen the movie, but, believe it's about slavery (it isn't) The wrong people have too much power in what the rest of us see and it isn't Disney, it isn't Marvel, it's the younger generation who demand all roles go to females or black people even if the role was written as a white male, especially if the role is about a white male."}, {"reviewer_name": "gjgcr", "date": "24 April 2021", "text": "I really liked some aspects of this show, i liked Isiah Bradkey storyline and Zemo in the show.

I would NOT watch an MCU film or show, and that's where this one in particular messes up. This show does really well with generalizing every group, minority, etc. A lot of these characters are just political stereotypes, which is guaranteed to piss off both liberals and conservatives. If the MCU wants to bring up BLM and show support for it in a film I've got no problem with that, but bringing in politics into it is only going to add division and controversy within its fan base.This show is the perfect example of that. When I have a conversation with someone about this show, 75% of the time they are going to bring up how political the show got for little to no reason, and 25% of the time they'll talk about the actual plot. That is NOT a good ratio, and it's sad because within the politics of this show, there is a good story with a lot of love put into it.

But I did have some issues with it too.I didn't like that Falcon gave away the shield. I know that his character was coming from a place of uncertainty and humility. Feeling as if he wouldn't measure up to Steve's legacy. But I still think it was the wrong choice. But I still like Sam/Falcon. He's likable and funny. I'd like to see more of him in the future.Bucky is my favorite part of the show so far. It's interesting to see where he is on his journey to becoming more of the man he used to be. But, from the first two episodes, it seems as if he's gone soft and not the badass fighter/killer he used to be. For instance, he loses a fight against a bunch of other super soldiers. Sure they had the odds, but Bucky is a highly trained super soldier. Whereas his enemies seem to only utilize their super strength. So I'd still give him the advantage on the fight. But, nevertheless, he still lost. And that pisses me off and it doesn't make sense.And then, there's the \"woke-ness\". It first began to rear it's ugly head in the first episode when Sam and his sister go to a bank to take out a loan, but the bank denies them. And the so-called writing alludes to possible racial profiling. With the sister even saying, \"it's funny how doors always seem to close when we're involved.\" Guys, can we PLEASE just have our escapist tv shows and movies actually be a form of escapism again?And then, it happens again in the second episode. With the revelation of there being, *SPOILER ALERT*.....are you ready, gang?....there was once, a black Captain America. *GASP!* His name is Isaiah. And the world has known nothing of him. Now I actually feel bad for the guy. Because he reveals that he was put in prison for 30 years and continually experimented upon. But the fact that we're still going on about racism, and exaggerating it is getting very annoying. Why is this real world issue in a superhero tv show?And after that; it gets even better! Sam is upset about the whole situation with Isaiah. And as far as the whole situation with the wrongful imprisonment and government coverup is concerned, I can understand why. And because of this Sam and Buck start to have a bit of an argument in the street. It seems like they're just gonna hash things out like friends and colleagues should. But then a confrontation between Sam, Bucky and the police is forcefully shoehorned into the next scene just seconds after Sam and Bucky leave Isaiah's house.It's a bit understandable as first that the police get involved just because the two men are having their argument in the middle of the street. But then the police, for some baffling reason, fixate on Sam and get nervous around him and start telling him to calm down. Sam tries to assure the officers that he is calm and declines to show them his ID when asked for it. But we're still not done. The cops then proceed to place their hands on their weapons as if fearing an attack from Sam at any moment. They even treat Bucky as if he's the victim of the argument. But then the whole situation is diffused once one of the officers tells his partner that they're dealing with the Falcon. Then they treat him with the utmost respect.Disney, please, I ask you to stop this over the top, in-your-face, brow beating about racism pandering that you are putting into more and more forms of your media. The more you focus on the negativity, the more it becomes a problem. Plus, you never present a solution, so why bother complaining about it? Just please, let your fans have the more lighthearted and fun side of the superhero story and leave out to overt \"woke-ness\". Because the audience that you're pandering to with that is the loud minority of your audience. Not the vast majority who already treats each other with respect and dignity.

It's unfortunate that there is no originality to this series and they are jumping on the leftist bandwagon. Disney and the writers are basically saying it is okay to entertain all by compromising values and serve a purpose of trying to convert people to your thinking... not very Captain America-esque. Also, the theme that it is the government's responsibility to step in and take care of all of its people to the point where everyone is dependent on the government and under their control is not the American values many people were raised. Unfortunately, all of these storylines made up for the overall theme for the rest of the season.

It contains some serious scenes and some humour, but are muddled together in a way that makes little sense and can switch between these in the same scene, making it very confusing and hard to connect with the characters.As well as this, the show (I feel) is poorly written. It again just gives you a sense it doesn't know what direction to go in, and almost feels improvised at times. Furthermore, there are times in the show that just don't make sense, and is not explained how or why these things happened. I can only be attribute this to poor writing and lack of thought gone into it.The characters in the show also feel like a shell of what they were in the movies at times. I'm all for character development but they sometimes just feel completely out of character.Finally, the show got slightly political in one of the episodes, it was very obvious and not subtle at all. This inevitably ruins the immersion and feels like they are trying to shove their political opinion down your throat.

Circumstances have allowed me to sit on my thoughts on the show for a couple of weeks, and allow healthy bit of perspective to sit in.Unwilling to keep hold of a shield that he doesn't feel worthy of, Sam Wilson (Anthony Mackie) hands it over to the Government. He and Bucky Barnes (Sebastian Stan) then start to investigate a terrorist organisation that is seeking to establish rights for refugees created by the return of the population, following the events of \"Endgame\". Their investigation has them turn to old friends, and enemies, for help before the government does the unthinkable, and choses a new Captain America themselves.Perhaps sensibly, \"Falcon\" doesn't try and do anything as inventive as \"Wandavision\" did. It's a much more traditional action 'buddy-cop' type story - though it does cleverly build on the narratives that have been running through the larger story for years. The action scenes, of which there is roughly one per episode are very well done though, and look as expensive and polished and anything we've seen in the movies. One of the themes that works well is bringing in the comics character of Isaiah Bradley, played by Carl Lumby, who tells his story as an African American who was forced to take the super soldier serum and survived, only to be imprisoned at tested on. His experiences juxtaposed against Sam's optimism are a good subplot.Less successful is the principle antagonists of the show, the terrorist organisation The Flag Smashers. Though Erin Kellyman is excellent, and it's great to hear any English accent other than a greater London/Estuary English one on a show of this scale, I don't feel I ever really got a handle on what their goal was. Daniel Bruhl though, is excellent as the returning Baron Zemo and though the show doesn't really offer any hint of it I really hope the MCU finds a way to use him again.If \"Wandavision\" was connecting tissue on the way to the next \"Doctor Strange\" film, \"Falcon\" feels like it opens up a range of stories and characters that can be used going forward. Though perhaps a little lacking in surprises there was a depth to the themes and stories that the MCU haven't gone to before, but if this level of quality can be maintained roll on \"Loki\""}, {"reviewer_name": "malty-185-488337", "date": "24 April 2021", "text": "Give them there own show but take away there powers or strengths.Show gets Boring and Political very Fast."}, {"reviewer_name": "spencereveritt-34358", "date": "13 April 2021", "text": "Score one more for the SJW destroying an icon.It feels to me the whole racist issue is forced.

For some reason, Marvel also thought it'd be worth their time to try and include some 'human' issues (not being able to pay rent etc.), which come off as patronising more than anything.The acting is rotten from the top down: besides the cringeworthy conflict of the two leads, characters like Zemo (Daniel Br\u00fchl) and Karli (Erin Kellyman) are prisoners to their restrictive scripting and personal range.

You guys had black president, and yet 30% of the story is basically \"Can we have a black frisbee thrower?\" Shockingly, yes! Who would have expected such turn of events? Ffs... So, there I was, expecting some interesting plot and action and I was left with Falcon trying to get a loan or getting harassed by police. It does not show the character progression, just the way this character is treated by others.I also did not like the ending of the \"I killed your son\" story, when it suddenly just cuts away after like 3 lines of dialogue, I thought it would be more highlighted.So, to sum up, show was decent but it was too political and a little bit all over the place.

Their \"struggle\" was not even clearly defined. They say that they were oppressed, but we never saw any of that. You have to show rather than tell. Also, the subplot involving Sam's sister seems very forced. I get that the writers want to give Sam some problems, but think of a better and more realistic way. The moments in which race relations in America was brought up was hit or miss for me. Sometimes I was moved, but sometimes I was just rolling my eyes.

The idea is that cap can throw it like that because he is cap. Why is the \"fake cap\" and then Sam Wilson just tossing it around?

There are some good action scenes but outside of those few scenes, nothing interesting happens. The show is very slow to develop, there is no chemistry between the leads and it feels like they were forced together. The two don't even meet in the first episode; when they meet in the second episode, they rush from \"you can't come along\" to \"we're partners and will do couples therapy\", despite only teaming up that same day. I could ignore the slow development and plot holes if there was an effort to be fun but there is none. I hear some compliment the \"representation\" in the show very highly but, once again, the show is boring. POSE is great show with lots of \"representation\" that is fun but Falcon and Winter Soldier is not. Simply having \"representation\" does not make up for lack of chemistry or interesting plot threads, you have to make an effort to write a good show. I know I'm ranting but I'm surprised at how highly this show is reviewed and do not understand.

They were trying to tackle some really big and complicated issues. The whole idea of the consequences of half the population returning after 5 years post-snap is a great philosophical question. It's a wonderful opportunity to explore major questions about humanity- who we are, what is possession, who gets what, and what are we owed from anyone else, given our circumstances? It has shades of imperialism, colonialism, disenfranchisement, jingoism, etc. And it would have been great to really dig into those issues using the snap as a framework. They just don't. It's not given any real proper treatment, and the problem is fixed and wrapped up in a bow not unlike some older episodes of south park where the characters finish with 'I learned something today'.I think they stumbled by having every character except falcon and bucky be bad. I get the desire to be more gritty, but Walker alone achieved that. They didn't need Sharon to be ambiguous and they certainly didn't need Julia Louis-Dreyfusses' character (though she is great in the role). Walker being a cynical post-Rogers attempt to market the symbol of Captain America was a good move though.... until he was forgiven for what he did. I mean, no consequences for killing a guy in cold blood like that? Not even the army works that way (though maybe the police...?). I found it really strange how he patted Bucky on the back at the end and the two of them basically had no issues with each other. He's clearly a villain and there is no reason up to that point why they should even tolerate each others' presence.Likewise- the Flag Crushers essentially just get killed for being terrorists, with no real thought about their motivations or their potential role as martyrs after death. I get that this was Zemo's role, but his role is also hamfisted. He ends up being a MacGuffin, and then a Chekov's gun, with no real explanation. It wraps things up tightly, but it all feels unearned and unsatisfying.And that brings us to race. The series is getting a lot of hate for being 'woke'. That's just wrong. It's not woke. It's just paying tribute to the experiences of other people. I get that, and I think it's fine. It's one of the few things it does consistently well. The idea that a lot of people wouldn't accept a black Captain America is probably (unfortunately) true. The people saying it's too woke need to try to expand their horizons a bit.Better luck next time. This is by far the worst Marvel material I've seen. It's a shame too, because the acting is pretty good. Everyone is doing a good job here, but they're just wasted on bad material. Has the Star Wars team of Disney moved to Marvel now?

It's not that either of them is particularly bad at acting, or the fact that this show doesn't really give either of them a chance to show that they're good at acting, it's that together, they have absolutely nothing going on, and every bit of supposed comradery falls flat. Add to that the horrible writing, that just leaves you rolling your eyes or sighing out loud over and over, this is a series you could easily skip and not miss out on a damn thing. There's some good character moments here or there, it's fun to see GSP again, and the *spoiler* Wakanda moments are probably the best in terms of action choreography, but overall this was a huge disappointment after watching Wandavision. The action scenes are incredibly poorly thought out, dull, and just don't use the characters to their full potential in the slightest. Although this is titled \"The Falcon and the Winter Solder\"\", it should really just be called \"The Falcon\" as the Winter Soldier feels very much an afterthought throughout, and very much at the ending. In the finale he does practically nothing aside from pull on a door real hard and sit by and watch as Falcon takes the spotlight over and over. Which is just the writers seemingly lacking any and all creativity in finding ways to hammer home how cool and badass the new Captain America is. I think you could have easily made both of them shine just as much without making it feel as thick and lazy as what made into the the final cut. Overall, the Winter Soldier only really feels like a badass superhero in his first moments in the show, when he's still a \"bad guy\". And the whole boat thing... my god. The winter solider showing falcon how to turn a bolt, then smiling at him was just dreadful. If you didn't already love the the characters from the films, just do yourself a favor and skip this. If you're expecting a show of the same caliber as Wandavision, then skip this.

I had high hopes for the series - the early trailers were promising, the cast was loaded with familiar faces, and the story seemed relevant to current events. Sadly, I was reminded again of how dangerous it can be to have high expectations.WARNING: SPOILERS AHEAD!The Falcon and the Winter Soldier follows Sam Wilson a.k.a. The Falcon (Anthony Mackie) and Bucky Barnes a.k.a. The Winter Soldier (Sebastian Stan) shortly after the events of Avengers: Endgame. The series starts off by following the two on their individual journeys. In the first episode, \"New World Order,\" Sam passes off Captain America's shield to the U. S. government and returns to Louisiana to help his sister keep their family boat while Bucky deals with the trauma of his past as the Winter Soldier. This episode was one of my favorites of the series, as it brims with the series' greatest strength: the exploration of Sam and Bucky's personal lives. Whenever F&WS takes a step back from the action and global antics, we are greeted with some solid character growth that promises great things for the MCU's future. This episode and episode 5 (\"Truth,\" my other favorite episode) excel at this. These episodes also deal with Sam's feelings toward potentially inheriting the \"Captain America\" mantle from Steve Rogers, providing some poignant and effective social commentary in doing so. More than a few conversations occur in episode 5 that focus on the idea of a \"Black Captain America\" and whether the people of the United States would be able to accept the idea. This aspect of the show pushes the introduction of Isaiah Bradley, a forgotten super soldier of the Vietnam War who ends up being one of the series' most interesting characters despite his small amount of screentime. His involvement in the show - and the happy ending he receives in the final episode (\"One World, One People\") - provides an interesting superhero-centric perspective on the history of race relations in America and optimistically suggests a brighter future for our country.Unfortunately, not all of the social commentary in the show works as well as what I just described. The Falcon and the Winter Soldier attempts to offer a similarly engaging commentary via its main antagonist: Karli Morgenthau. Karli is the leader of an organization called the \"Flag Smashers,\" which leads a global effort to eliminate international borders that have become heavily enforced in the wake of the Blip. With Karli, Marvel tries to execute an approach similar to Thanos from Avengers: Infinity War or the Vulture from Spider-Man: Homecoming. In theory, she works well as a \"gray-area villain.\" She has motivations that are valiant in essence, but she seeks the completion of her goals using violent and immoral means. This could have worked beautifully if she wasn't the most boring character in the entire show. Her development is driven entirely by fistfuls of corny dialogue that is intended to come off as thought-provoking but comes off as anything but. Her objectives throughout the series are frustratingly vague, to the point where I never really understood what she was trying to accomplish or why. Karli and the Flag Smashers become the focus of the final episode's lengthy action sequences, which makes that last episode aggressively uninteresting. Sam's speech near the end of that episode brings up some decent points around the idea of labels (the word \"terrorist\" in this case), but it's too little too late. Karli ends up being another missed opportunity in Marvel's Antagonist Department - F&WS suffers as a result.The remaining supporting characters in the show are a mixed bag. John Walker, one of The Falcon and the Winter Soldier's more interesting characters, is introduced at the end of episode 1 as the new Captain America. His introduction is great: we are initially led to despise him as the unworthy inheritor of the shield, but episode 2 (\"The Star-Spangled Man\") quickly remedies this by explaining that he is both a decorated war veteran and a nervous young man eager to fill the big shoes he has been handed. Throughout the remainder of the series, however, his development bounces all over the place. The potential dichotomy introduced in episode 2 is overridden shortly by the decision to portray John as annoying, narrow-minded, and irrational. He suddenly becomes much more interesting at the end of episode 4 (\"The Whole World is Watching\") when he brutally murders a Flag Smasher in front of dozens of cameras after taking a spare vial of super soldier serum. However, his character is sidelined for the last two episodes - dumping the potentially fascinating exploration of the aftermath of his actions - until his partial redemption in the series finale and lackluster introduction as U. S. Agent (pulled from the comics).Sharon Carter and Helmut Zemo are also in the series, and their additional screentime does nothing but hurt the characters that were introduced in Captain America: The Winter Soldier and Civil War. Sharon's inexplicable (yet entirely predictable) turn as the villainous Power Broker makes no sense, and the weak writing given to the character highlights Marvel's struggle to create a compelling female character (Captain Marvel, anyone?). Zemo's addition to the cast was exciting at first, until his newfound goofiness, sporadic and nonsensical motivations, and low growl of a voice undoes everything that made him interesting in Civil War. He does get to put on his comic-accurate mask for a hot second... I guess that was cool. The two episodes featuring Zemo (\"Power Broker\" and \"The Whole World is Watching\") were also the series' weakest episodes, as they lacked logical writing, hard-hitting action, or engaging character beats.Aside from the hit-or-miss characters and screenwriting, The Falcon and the Winter Soldier doesn't offer much else to redeem itself. The action sequences - something that Marvel fans have come to have high expectations for - come nowhere close to the level of quality seen in other entries in the MCU. Episode 1's opening action sequence, where Sam chases a group of terrorists in Middle Eastern airspace, is satisfyingly thrilling. Episode 5's opening hand-to-hand combat scene between Sam, Bucky, and John was surprisingly well-filmed and edited, creating a hard-hitting, visceral, and personal fight. Episode 6's bombastic action set piece has some sporadic standout moments. Other than those three exceptions I mentioned, the action didn't do much for me. Between the quick cuts, shaky camera, and obvious stunt work, the thrills fall short of their potential and don't make up for the other areas of the show that are lacking. Paired with the thin writing, this makes the \"adventure episodes\" that see Sam, Bucky, and Zemo traversing around the world in search of the Flag Smashers supremely flat.Finally, I'll round off my criticisms of F&WS by pointing out that Sam's introduction as the new Captain America in the series finale did not come with the \"oomph\" that it should have. Rather than cheering, applauding, and tearing up at his arrival in New York wearing a new suit and wielding the shield, I found myself passively watching his scenes thinking: \"I guess the new suit looks cool.\" I appreciated that the writers made the decision not to give Sam a dose of super soldier serum (though I wonder how he'll be able to lead the defense against potentially world-ending threats without it) and enjoyed the speech about \"labels\" that he gave after the finale's climax. However, I found the overall execution of what should have been a momentous occasion uninspired and poorly written. I hope this can be revisited and remedied in future MCU installments.The Falcon and the Winter Soldier was a frustrating disappointment and a waste of an incredible opportunity. The series could have been a tight, engaging thrill-ride that used its position to explore the aftermath of Avengers: Endgame in detail, provide some much-needed character development for its titular and supporting characters, feature poignant social commentary about the world we live in today, and introduce our new Captain America in rousing fashion. F&WS succeeds in some of those areas: the series shines its brightest in its examination of Sam and Bucky's personal lives, bringing their larger lives as superheroes down to a relatable and emotional level. The show's commentary on race relations in America also works well and is incorporated uniquely into a superhero show. Unfortunately, the remainder of the series falls flat. The Flag Smasher-driven plot is uninteresting and poorly written, other supporting characters like Sharon Carter and Helmut Zemo are not compelling in the slightest, and the action that Marvel has become famous for only works well on occasion. Ultimately, Marvel will need to step up its game a LOT to keep me interested in these Disney+ shows. Here's hoping that Loki offers something much more exciting and engaging. It saddens me to give The Falcon and the Winter Soldier 4 out of 10 stars."}, {"reviewer_name": "mohammedsalehali99", "date": "30 April 2021", "text": "Coming in to watch this show after all the trailers and promos, one can only expect good things.

All the way from Iron Man to Avengers: Endgame. I love all the films, and they have a certain magic to them when you watch them. I was excited to watch their first ever series, Wandavision. I was expecting something new and exciting, and it was ok, but wasn't great. I put this down mainly to not liking the characters as much perhaps. I was more excited to watch The Falcon and the Winter Soldier, as I knew it was going to be action packed and feature Zemo, one of my favourite villains. The first episode was terrible. They give us a magnificent, action packed opening, hint at an underlying storyline which I was excited to learn more about. Then the episode completely veers off into Sam's family background, and the rest of the episode revolves around an argument about a boat. What the hell. With very little going on in Bucky's world. Then at the end of the episode, we return to what I actually cared about and wanted to watch, which was the villain gang known as the Flagsmashers. Roll credits. Not much happened. Episode 2. Sam and Bucky randomly meet with no build up or real progression. Their stories don't intertwine, they just randomly appear together. Good action, boring villain, interesting characters. Then from episode 3 to 4, we have random bursts of bloody brutal violence that is completely unlike marvel and out of style. I thought these were kids shows? Bloody violence is not common in marvel films, but, here it is in a series. I personally liked the adult theme, but I wouldn't let my kids watch that. Episode 5, complete garbage. Repeat of episode 1 - great opening scene, rubbish filling about a meaningless boat. Maybe they ran out of ideas so decided to return to the pointless boat story? Oh and of course, the whole racial deal. I think the black super soldier puts it as 'a white folk shield'. Ok :/Overall, to sum everything up, I don't know what the hell is going on at marvel, and I don't think they even know. Their style changes so much throughout the series I think they forgot what they are best at doing? They must have lost a sense of their audience too, which is primarily children. Each episode feels different, like it doesn't fit as a whole, and don't get me started on the weird camera choices (I am a filmmaker myself). Oh and the boring villain who no one cares about. Did I mention that? Can we see more of John Walker maybe? Far more interesting. Let's hope Loki saves them, cause this is no good."}, {"reviewer_name": "dancohenWPB", "date": "11 April 2021", "text": "The trailers for F&WS had me pumped for this series. The opening scene gave me high hopes this was MCU on the small screen. After four episodes I've come to the following conclusions:The script, specifically important plot devices, is overall unimaginative and requires character choices that are inconsistent with the character's core values. There are some cool concepts such as Bucky in therapy and Sam trying to get a loan after being gone five years from the blimp, but several plot devices where painfully bad. For example, Bucky helping Zemo escape prison seems incredibly far outside his ethos based on his character arch. There had to be a more creative way for Zemo to get out of jail that didn't involve a buzzard set-up. Also, the reduction of the Wakandan elite guard (Dora Milaje) to easily distracted impulsive warriors to the point their target Zemo is able to escape felt stupid. Again, unimaginative writing.The directing is really bad. The actors, who are overall strong, seem like they are struggling with character motivation and outside of a few really good scenes (the couples counseling scene for example) the performances feel flat.The villain is far from compelling. I don't care about gender switching a role but the villain has to make you feel SOMETHING. Erin Kellyman is a strong actor but she unfortunately miscast in this role. Her sweetness misplaced and her anger is unbelievable.The actors are doing their best. If it wasn't for great actors and familiar characters this would be a complete failure.The pacing is SLOW. This could have been edited down to a fun Disney Plus made for TV movie. Being only 6 episodes, I'm curious if Feige tried to improve the pacing by making it a shorter series.

However, this is exactly how it went in the comics: Cap \"dies\" and passes the shield down to Sam, Sam and the government don't think America is ready for a \"Black\" Captain America, the government responds by keeping up the usual Captain America image which backfires, and Sam comes around and becomes Captain America after all (of course there's more to it than that but that's the basic scenario).Other than that... the show is just boring. When no one is fighting there's a lot of stiff dialogue. Personally, I don't care for Anthony Mackie as an actor, he's pretty stale to me. He has two angles: frustrated and sarcastic, he doesn't bring much else to the character. Bucky has a lot more depth, PTSD, survivors guilt, assassins guilt (if that's a thing), and a general longing for human connection. Bucky is really well written.

Are you ready to watch a show that will belly laugh and also immerse you in an emotional ride of a lifetime? Well if so, The Falcon and the Winter Soldier is the show for you! Anthony Mackie and Sebastian Stan return in iconic roles, delivering mind-blowing action choreography and creative new ways to show action like Marvel hasn't achieved before. This will definitely bring a smile to long time Marvel fans, and it will also be extremely enjoyable for first time Marvel viewers.The Falcon and the Winter Soldier is set six months after the events of Avengers: Endgame, establishing the current status of Sam Wilson (Anthony Mackie) and Bucky Barnes (Sebastian Stan). Sam (aka the Falcon) is still completing missions fighting crime left and right. Bucky (aka the Winter Soldier), on the other hand, is lying very low. He is dealing with mental health issues, trying to make peace with himself and the world. When the terrifying villain Zemo makes his reappearance from the events of Captain America: Civil War, Bucky and Sam must team up and defeat this foe.In Captain America: Civil War, we get a taste of the Anthony Mackie and Sebastian Stan duo. Everyone loved it. Now to satisfy our lust for more, we have The Falcon and the Winter Soldier. Their chemistry is outstanding. You laugh consistently throughout the show, making you want more and more. The visual effects and writing departments each deserve a lot of credit for the extremely creative route the show takes, demonstrating to the world what beautiful effects Marvel can produce.The Falcon and the Winter Soldier is intense at times. A good portion of the show is pure action that some parents might not be comfortable with their younger children seeing. Some episodes contain mild cursing. The show does offer many morals and lessons. It explores themes such as teamwork, love and friendship. It also teaches the lesson that, even though you might have lost someone you love, they would have wanted you to move on and continue to live the life you want.The Falcon and the Winter Soldier soars higher than the Falcon does in the show, delivering plenty of great laughs and action-packed scenes. The show does contain intense action and cursing. Therefore, I give The Falcon and the Winter Soldier 5 out of 5 stars and recommend it for ages 11 to 18, plus adults.

What makes the GRC so bad for Carly? Why don't they work more on the idea of the shield as a mantle?

While I liked parts of it, as others have mentioned in their reviews, I couldn't get past the political garbage they kept throwing in there. First of all, almost no one in this country would have a problem with a black Captain America because of the color of his skin. But, the movie implies that there are enough white supremacists in this country where they need to have some kind of blatant counter narrative to educate white folks. They dip back to the sins of the past and bring them forward as if this the same country as it was back then. Almost no one who would be watching this movie was alive back then. I was for the tail end, and we've moved past all of that, although the media and Hollywood keep doing their best to pull us back in to those times. They are the ones trying to divide us. Unfortunately, it looks like Hollywood and now Disney has bought into Critical Race Theory, so they must assume that all white people are oppressors, even if they are not aware of it, and thus need to be educated about their white privilege. That theory also says all minorities are oppressed and are victims, even if they are not aware of it or do not feel oppressed. Stop it Disney! Don't ruin your TV shows and movies.That being said, I don't think Sam should have been the heir to the Captain America shield and name, and it has nothing to do with the color of his skin. I don't think John Walker should have been either. I don't like the idea of a Captain America that has normal human powers. Bucky should have been the guy. He was the obvious and best choice. He's a super-soldier like Steve Rogers, he is from the same era, and like Sam, he was also Roger's friend (although for a lot longer). Thinking that a normal person could train and have the skills and reflexes necessary to handle that shield the way Rogers did takes away the mystique of Captain America.

The Flag Smashers are a fairly generic villain that never rely move into a truly memorable or feared territory.2. The new Captain America is a great, almost psuedo-villain that I would have loved to have see more focus on. The final battle sees him accepting someone else as Cap with literally no push back, which is pretty out of character given how he acts in the episodes leading up to that point3. Comics have always been political, so shining a light on the struggles a black man/hero in America made sense. A few of these moments felt a bit watered-down and it would have been nice to see the series go into that even further. Seeing how butthurt people got about what was, included is probably why Disney/Marvel didn't go deeper here."}, {"reviewer_name": "maepealoza", "date": "29 April 2021", "text": "Sam is a good protagonist but sometimes he is really fool and the antagonist is so boring and useless."}, {"reviewer_name": "jparkerez-07280", "date": "24 April 2021", "text": "Marvel should have paid the Russo brother's any amount of money to be the show runners.

I mean yes falcon becomes captain America but there's barely any suspense and the plot is not intriguing. Let's start with karli morgenthau: I didn't even care about her until the third episode because half of what comes out of her mouth didn't make any sense. I never fully understood her motivations. Like at least give her a costume, all she wore was like a hoodie and khakis and a lame terrorist mask lol. The flag smashers are just forgettable villains, who I guess basically have the same goals as Thanos (poor writing). Now Bucky and Sam are pretty likeable characters and I liked sam's internal conflict with the captain America reputation driving the series, but like only 30 min of the entire 6 episodes was focused on bucky's story arc. I would've liked to see more revealed about his past. John Walker was a more interesting villain but he was still an annoying a**hole in every episode. He made some dumb decisions and I have no sympathy for him. But in general the dialogue was just kinda boring and made me zone out. Marvel tried to make the plot overly complex and political but nobody gives a damn. Wandavision was complex but wasn't too boring; it was like marvel meets The Twilight Zone with plot twists scattered throughout the series. You had to keep coming back to watch it. With this series the plot nor the characters were worth investing my time in. I don't want to watch them fix a boat for 20 min lol. Don't even get me started about Marvel's attempts to be Woke and feeding audiences leftist propaganda.The one part of this that I like was Zemo. He was actually a likeable villain. He was pretty forgettable in civil war but now they turned him into an intelligent Hannibal Lecter kind of villain. I wanted more of him, not Sharon Carter (I never understood wtf the power broker even means) and Julia Louis Dreyfus."}, {"reviewer_name": "sumtim3s00n", "date": "16 April 2021", "text": "This show has some good moments and interesting plausible storyline/villains however its all wrapped up too heavily in woke nonsense that too often shadows everything else.The foundations often seem more to be a soc-pol commentary rather than it is based on the storyline. Comics always strive to bring people together. Why do we have to have a grumpy racist old man instead of someone who sees the inequalities but also sees hope and trys to instill it and while bringing awareness to problems ? And does not make new generations even more jaded and hateful. That is what comic books always were, balanced, bringing hope and equality. Not hate on basis of inequality.The staple of shows today seems to be that white men are inherently guilty of everything. Only they have to assume responsibility nobody else no matter what. Narrowminded people think they are \"bringing issues to light\" but this is only creating MUCH MORE DIVISION. I love the Marvel universe and comic book shows and movies and some are very balanced with story first, the underlying moral message below it. Here its the other way around and with no balance in sight.All in all, its quite a good show in many aspects but like too many shows today is too onesided, too politicized, woke and creating huge chasms between people instead of bringing them together."}, {"reviewer_name": "Valken-Industries", "date": "7 April 2021", "text": "The acting feels forced, all the other Marvel movies they work so well together, from an acting stand point.

The flag smashers motto was pretty vague and they just looked like regular street teen thugs asking for a nice flogging. The stakes were never too high. Besides, it seems now every other jerk now has access to the super soldier serum, and surprisingly they are even able to give our superheroes some nice thrashing.

Why are they angry? What is the cause? How will they achieve it? The biggest other negatives are Falcon's captain American outfit looks stupid. Walker US Agent should not have had a redemption moment in this series because it weighs down an overloaded plot with so many characters already. He should have been out of the story after he killed a man. And why would he get walk away scott free? Seinfield Lady was horrible in her role and confusing. So we have to set up some other plot line nobody cares about in a short miniseries?Now having said that, all the other actors and their characters were good to great. But it all fell apart at the end because how can you feel the story concluded well when your villains have no defined objectives and were not played very well. Except for Zemo that is, who was great. Falcon saves the day and his speech was great yet because everything and everyone (except Falcon and Winter Solider) is unclear as to who stands where and for what. Perhaps I am nitpicking but I think the Falcon should have just stayed the Falcon but would CA's shield. Be your own man and I detest superheroes being comandeered by other characters.

But if it hadn't been for her, I'd have stopped watching this after the first two or three episodes.The socio-political racial inequality browbeating just became unbearable. The writers have carefully crafted into the storyline that the audience is supposed to take the same journey of \"realization\" as the Falcon character. His original reasons for not wanting to take on the Captain America mantle have nothing to do with injustice; he just feels as though the original Captain America shield belongs with its original bearer and that he is not that character. But as the story progresses, he is being told that the shield embodies social injustice and that he is not meant to have it because he's black.So now we are expected to apologize for not understanding the \"woke\" reason Falcon did not want to take the shield, just as Bucky did toward the close of the next to last episode.Are the writers going to make Falcon a super soldier or are we expected to believe he's just superhuman out of the box?...cue scene from \"The Winter Soldier\" where Steve Rogers is running laps near the Lincoln Memorial and Falcon can't match him. I had no problem with Falcon taking the Captain's shield but now I do since it's become a soapbox for politics. The Captain and the colors of his uniform embodied our Nation's sense of pride and victory in WWII and Falcon could have done that as well, but that storyline doesn't fit the progressive mold."}, {"reviewer_name": "racoonito", "date": "25 April 2021", "text": "I loved this story soo much the acting was perfect and you could feel the characters i really enjoyed Daniel Bruhl returning in his zemo role.

My general opinion could be negative but the leads characters are very charismatics and they hold the show.

If I would describe it I think I would say Jack Ryan with Marvel characters as it has that authenticity and focus on characters with a slow paced political thriller plot. Malcolm Spellman served as the showrunner for the mini series and I found the writing to be quite good and the focus on the world building and characters was appreciated. The world felt much more real and the writing is a big factor in that, I also like the themes that they go into, bringing up racism and stuff like that is needed. The tone is a mix of the original lighthearted but also dark in terms of Captain America: Winter Soldier and Civil War because the story feels like it could happen in the real world, there aren't any wizards nor aliens, and the only sci-fi element are the Super Soldier serum. The dialogue is perfect, I think the actors even improvised some lines, the execution is the most important and they succeed in that. The Falcon and the Winter Soldier is six episodes of great drama and thriller worth watching. The ensemble cast is fairly big but everyone gets the screen time they need which fits the story, character development is the show's strong point.The fight choreography is at times similar to the previous Captain America movies which some might call lack of originality but I call it fan service, it's also nice to see the characters fight in the same ways. The fight and action sequences are extremely well done and super entertaining to watch, and they are there for the story which is a good thing and something some movies fail to do as they keep putting unnecessary action sequences. Super Soldiers is a joy to watch and The Falcon and the Winter Soldier has a bunch of them, it doesn't get old though. The writers managed to make them human and not action figures.Falcon and Winter Soldier is played by Anthony Mackie and Sebastian Stan, they got the leading roles and I have always believed that they could carry a movie or TV show without Captain America, the chemistry they share and how enjoyable they are together. You just smile when they're on the screen. It isn't really any spoilers that these two characters which didn't really like each other becomes friends throughout the TV series, their mutual friend wanted it to happen since they met. Being completely different from one and the other, their life look similar. Bucky trying to make amends after his long time as The Winter Soldier, whilst Sam Wilson have other trouble to take care of. The trouble they take care of makes them more human and made me care for them even more, I really never saw Falcon as a main character before but Anthony Mackie really went all in this time and showed how capable he is to run the show. Huge praise for them both and the writers that seem to care and understand the characters, and legacy of Captain America.Wyatt Russell portrays the new Captain America, John Walker. He does a terrific job with the performance, it's one of the best of the TV Series. Its easy to sympathize with him as he's a character with many flaws and so human, he's not the typical MCU character and the thing with this show is that many characters are flawed and could easily be found in our world. John Walker is easily one of the highlights in the show and I really hope Wyatt Russell gets another shot in the upcoming Captain America movie. Daniel Br\u00fchl reprises his role as Baron Zemo as the anti-villain as his previously appearance was in Captain America: Civil War where he was the villain of the story, I have always found him to be a great villain as his reasons are understandable and realistic. Daniel Br\u00fchl gets to do much more with the character here and it improves the character immensely as we get to know him on a more personal level which I'll say the same to the other villains of the story, the \"terrorist\" group called Flag Smashers which is led by Karli Morgenthau which is played by Erin Kellyman. Other returning or worth mentioning characters are Sharon Carter, Joaquin Torres and Sarah Wilson.Camera work and cinematography is superb, everything looks excellent. Kari Skogland served as the director for all 6 episodes and her talent shows in the visual storytelling and direction she gave. She also seem to love the source material. Sound editing and musical score is fantastic, everything sounds perfect. The music has that epic and heroic sound, inspired by the Captain America movies but ultimately it's own thing. Set pieces and locations are amazing, then there are locations like Madripoor that's absolutely stunning to look at. Production and art design, everything was perfect."}, {"reviewer_name": "flying_meha", "date": "31 May 2021", "text": "I CAN'T BELIEVE...* SUPERHERO NEEDS MONEY TO BUY PAINT BUT THEY DO NOT GIVE HIM A CREDIT * THE STORY OF ALL 6 EPISODES IS THAT THE DEPARTED CAPTAIN AMERICA WAS A GOOD MAN AND HOW FALCON MADE A BIG MISTAKE AND HOW THE SHIELD IS NOW IN THE WRONG HANDS * WITH TWO GOOD SCENES MASKED WHOLE STORY * WATCHING CAN BE LEFT AT ANY MOMENT, NO REGRETS !!! * I RECOMMEND FOR PERSONS UNDER 5 YEARS OLD AND\nFOR PERSONS WITH IQ <36."}, {"reviewer_name": "charleski2000", "date": "24 April 2021", "text": "Apparently the solution to problems with immigration is to have a guy in a silly costume give world leaders a stern talking-to.It had its moments, but overall this is ridiculously juvenile stuff even for Marvel."}, {"reviewer_name": "santiiba", "date": "5 April 2021", "text": "Literraly everebody hates it for no reason, this 3 episodes were better than the wandavision's first 3 but people hates it for no reason."}, {"reviewer_name": "riddifordhenry", "date": "19 March 2021", "text": "Marvel Studios' second show The Falcon and the Winter Soldier has a great start that jumps right into the action in the beginning, then sets up the series in a somewhat slow manner.

Very welcome surprise to see MMA legend Georges St. Pierre as the head bad guy, too.Anthony Mackie, as The Falcon, is easily the best thing in the show, and he adds a lot of depth and feeling to his performance, making a lot out of an otherwise forgettable script. It's nice to see him finally getting a starring role after paying his dues for so long in all those Marvel films.The Winter Soldier, on the other hand, is unfocused and unlikeable, seeming little like his role in the Captain America films, and alternating between being gloomily impotent and endlessly guilty and then engaging in light sit-com-like quips and awkward humour, which are ill-fitting in tone and poorly-judged, and don't add up to any recognizable personality. The writers have given us nothing to like in him.Every other character is similarly underdeveloped and dull. There's the usual forced diversity quotas and political messaging, though they are relatively subtle for 2021. But regardless, every white man on the show is, as usual, either flawed, weak or evil, and all minorities and women are wholesome, brave and good. It seems very likely the show is going to slide more strongly into racial politics as it goes along, but they did at least keep a loose rein on it for the first episode.

Fight scenes are getting better at every episodes too.Dislikes:Didn't like the new captain america (John Walker) concept at first, mostly is because of my endearment towards Steve Rogers. But seems like he is necessary in the story to spike things up.The new persona of Zemo felt a little weird and out of place too. The impression I had of him in the Captain America: Winter Soldier film was a devastated family man who was blinded by revenge. All of a sudden he's a rich & well-connected man?Not fond of Erin Kellyman who portrayed Karli. Didn't make her character seem any dangerous at all. I think Wyatt Russell (John Walker) did a better job than her in making his character dangerous.An overly-deliberate attempt in emphasizing \"black people\" in the series. Yes, we are all trying to encourage racial harmony, even though some parts of the world are still facing serious racism issues, but having it mentioned not once, not twice, but several times at every single episode, I think enough is enough. If this is in the original story of the Marvel's comic book, then fine, I give it to them. Otherwise, I think it's very redundant and annoying.WandaVision started off awkward for me at first, because I couldn't understand the reason for the black/white TV sitcom and couldn't see where it was going. But after watching further on, it finally made sense, sort of gave me an idea how things are going to evolve in future Phase 4 films.

Both shows had a lot of potential for greatness, but fell flat by the end. Before I get into my issues, I'll go over what I liked about The Falcon and the Winter Soldier. So far, the best part about these Disney+ Marvel shows is that they made me like some of these characters more. Before these shows, I didn't really care about Wanda, Vision, Falcon, Bucky, and Zemo. Now, I do. These shows did a great job at fleshing out these characters and making them more compelling.Another aspect of the show I liked was exploring post-Endgame society. It was interesting to see how the events of Endgame affected the world. The writers did a good job at incorporating real-world issues into the show.Now that I went into the positives, it's time to go into the negatives. The show's biggest issue for me was how John Walker was wasted. Everything up until Episode 4 was perfect. The episodes served as a nice build-up for Walker's villainous turn. However, I felt like Episode 5 and 6 dropped the ball for this character. I got a lot of Homelander vibes from Walker and I'm disappointed that they didn't use him more as a villain.I also thought the Flag Smashers weren't that interesting as the main villains. I would've preferred it if they served as the main threat for the first half of the show, then got replaced by Walker in the second half.Overall, The Falcon and The Winter Soldier was a decent experience. The show made Falcon, Bucky, and Zemo more compelling to me and explored post-Endgame society in an interesting way. However, the Flag Smashers were uninteresting villains and John Walker was wasted.

The first action sequence was exciting but the pace of the scene was way too quick, it was getting chopped and change of angles constantly when they are fighting on the plane, it is one of my most hated things in TV shows and films. Why do you need to cut one scene in to 6 different frames?The rest of the episode was learning more about Falcons family (his sister and 2 nephews) and how they are trying to get by after \"the blip\", personally I always find it interesting to see how Marvel tries to humanise these superheroes and I think they have done a good job especially with Falcon. Falcon also handed Captain America's shield over to the Government and Falcon is essentially trying to find his own path without the Cap there to guide him and I believe he is trying to live up to him.Winter soldier (Bucky) is trying to find his purpose throughout this episode by speaking to a therapist and going on a date. There was no new action from Bucky as such, only a scene about one of the assassinations he did when he was under control from Hydra.Overall, it was an interesting episode, not loads of action but enough to get by and enjoy it.

Even the decision to have the new Captain America go unhinged was a great choice, and could have made a great story. Sam's worries about the world accepting a black Captain America, (while a little bit of a stretch considering War Machine and Nick Fury both being high ranking officials), could have made a great story as well, following the \"White, blond hair, blue eyes\" expectation.Unfortunately, the bumbling writing, off kilter pacing, and subpar direction take this lineup of very promising factors and take a dump on them. More than I was bored watching the weightless, tensionless action, (save for one scene with Walker), I was disappointed at the prospect of what could have been, given better handling.The writers of the show seem to have skipped the chapter in the textbook on \"show don't tell\" because very few times did we see anyone at all hesitating at the idea of a black Captain America. All we got was several speeches about how people wouldn't accept a black Captain America, and an exposition dump about a previous black super soldier. Sam's assumption that people wouldn't accept him due to his race comes out of nowhere, as he is shown to not only be well known as the Falcon, after fighting alongside Steve and the Avengers for years, but to be well liked by the public. This is not to say that this storyline had no merit, as it could have been a powerful message to show people acting against Sam due to his race, despite his service. Instead of having Sam assume that his being Captain America wouldn't be taken well, show us his story. In the end of the show, he has no real reason to change his mind and become Captain America. Because there is no defining reason that he made his decision in the first place, there is no defined reason that he changes his mind. Weak motivation led to weak growth.Bucky's story had amazing potential as well. The PTSD and guilt that comes with his years as the Winter Soldier is a very powerful motivator, but his story gets sidelined by all the time spent explaining (not showing) that a black Captain America wouldn't be okay in the eyes of the public. I found his story to be underdeveloped, and would liked to have seen more time dedicated to it.John Walker's story was amazing, and by far the best part of the show, until the end. Wyatt Russell puts in a phenomenal nuanced performance as the new Captain America descends into madness. You feel it as he becomes more rugged and unhinged, both through the acting and through the costume choices. When John Walker ends up killing a man in the streets, it's shocking, but earned. Then in the last episode he makes one good choice and we're all buddy buddy again! It's jarring, how quickly Bucky and John start paling around, especially considering Bucky's character arc. John Walker deserved a less rushed, less extreme 180.The direction of the show was abysmal at worst, and passable at best. All action scenes with the falcon made him seem floaty, weak, and like he had little to no impact on the situation. The fight choreography had Bucky, who fought Captain America on numerous occasions, and was 1/2 of the duo that defeated Iron Man, losing repeatedly to new super soldiers with no fighting experience. The camera work was less than amazing, repeatedly coming back to close ups of characters faces, especially during Falcons flight scenes, and weirdly during Bucky's first therapy session.The show did have good points! John Walkers arc was excellent until the final episode. The Falcon's family home felt real, (leaving out some of the performances and writing around child actors that seemed straight out of a Disney XD show), if not a little out of place at times. When Falcon is reasoning with Morgenthau on a time constraint due to the unhinged John Walker, the connection is real, as well as the tension. Anthony Mackie brings his skills as the understanding former soldier that made me love the character in the Winter Soldier. Zemo was an interesting ally from start to finish.Overall, lots of good, but lots of bad as well. The Falcon and the Winter Soldier stumbles with it's messages, and unfortunately gives more individuals reason to believe that comic books and politics should be separate, despite them never being separate throughout history. What could have been a great show ends up being an often boring letdown."}, {"reviewer_name": "rileysollerud", "date": "20 March 2021", "text": "He definitely is on the moon. I am sure of it.

It was well written, especially for all the difficulties that this series went through, it did well. I feel the chemistry between the actors who play Falcon and Winter Soldier was great. I want to share my concern about the negative reviews. I see some people are saying the plot. I get that because the story had to be changed due to similarities to the pandemic. However, the comments that it was too politically was outrageous. This is what I find interesting: if Falcon who is a black man shares his experience and what life would be like as a black person, it's political. On the other hand if Wanda Maximoff has relations with an inanimate object and her desires for it, that's wonderful storytelling. That's a great storyline. I am shock and appalled. They said the villian was not as strong. There have been several villians in the MCU who were not so strong but that did not mean the plot was weak.Here is Carly's mission in the series: she wanted to restore things the way it was during the blip. People were united as one people and one world without political borders. Her cause does get blurred. Her means of going about it was to attack the GRC(Global Reparation Comittee) because they were trying to figure out how to put all these displaced people back in home and fed. Unfortunately, people were not getting enough supplies and food. Remember when half the universe was destroyed people on planet Earth helped one another. Carly wanted it back that way. Also GRC was favoring one group over the other. The power broker gave Carly the means to get what she wanted. Carly needed to be stopped due to her insane tactics (not due to her goals). Can the Falcon and Winter Soldier stop her or will she succeed in destroying the GRC? Will Carly succeed in getting one world and one people again.The story arc for John Walker was amazing.

I mean, even the original hulk was better than this. I enjoyed the first two episodes. They had some great action scenes and some funny moments. My favorite part about it was winter soldier's therapy session in the first episode, I found that scene pretty funny. Then came episode three and everything wen't downhill afterwards. There are multiple problems with this show and I will list a couple of them.1. CarlieShe was one of the most weak sauce villains ever. What the hell was her motivation? Maybe if they put in some backstory about her past during those five years it would've been better, but instead all we got was her complaining about how tough it was when we have no idea what she was talking about. They tried to make her relatable, but there was nothing to relate to. Yeah, let's relate to some angry girl who kills people to spark a fire for her little movement that makes no sense. Yeah Disney, I'll do just that. Then there's the fact that after she died everyone felt so sad and sorry. SHE WAS A TERRORIST! WHY WOULD WE FEEL BAD? She was not thought well enough and she is an example of weak writing.2. The titleThe title ticks me off. They call it Falcon and the Winter Soldier. What it should be called is Falcon. I was hoping the show would have a buddy cop vibe and it did for the first two episodes, but then it should flipped all the way to Falcon. This was something I was extremely disappointed with, because Bucky was pretty much the only good character in the show.3. The politicsThen there's the whole thing about people \"not wanting\" a black Captain America. This was done horribly. Never once in the show or in the entirety of the MCU did anyone say anything about not wanting a black Captain America and then all of a sudden it's an issue? This was very stupidly done. Yes, I see that they were trying to add some realism into the MCU, but they did it all wrong. In a fictional world where there has been no problems with this sorta thing and then all of a sudden it does is bad world building.This show is a mess.

The main villan(s) however, not so much. There wasn't enough done to build sympathy for these would be villans or their cause which we are told is fighting a system that isn't helping people like they should after the hulk undoes the snap. Given this is only a 6 episode series, they probably could have put in a couple of more episodes focusing on what the world is like to help flesh this out.The action itself was decent, however I personally felt Bucky was getting smacked around a bit more than he should have been given his training and the fact he is fighting a bunch of pouty tweens regardless of them being super soldiers.The revelation that Sharon Carter was the power broker or that we are strongly led to believe she is, was pretty predictable in my opinion, but again I wish they would have spent more time focusing on this part of the story as opposed to the direction they went with the super soldier kids.All in all, it's not terrible, but definitely not as good as I was hoping."}, {"reviewer_name": "jimmyllewellyn", "date": "24 April 2021", "text": "It's depressing to see all the focus on the supposed leftist or woke nature of the story.

If LeBron can make millions playing a game, I'm pretty damn sure Sam would have been compensated accordingly, at least to the point of fixing up a super old fishing boat.

I don't buy it at all.I rated this show low because it forced me out of fantasy and back into reality; but did so in an unconvincing and contrived way. I just watched a behind the scenes episode of this show, and to see the black writers and Anthony complain about how hard it is to be black in America-while being a part of the biggest franchise in the world-is the equivalent of spitting in the face of the general public. I mean, Anthony did a YouTube video of what he does in a day, and starts off in his huge steam shower. TF?

Without them, it would be so much worse. But the best thing about this series is John Walker AKA US Agent. I loved this character and Wyatt Russell was fantastic as him. At first, he's pretty unlikable but he has a reason to be and then he goes completely off the deep end and looses his mind and that was really cool to watch. Zemo was okay I guess. He was better here than in Civil War but that's not saying much.Now for the bad: the main villain is terrible. She's this delusional, psycho girl with messed up beliefs and is the leader of a group called the \"flag smashers\" (not joking) and she was poorly written and annoying. It also didn't help that the actress was terrible. Another glaring problem is the action sequences. They're filmed in a very sluggish way for the most part with jump cuts, awful shaky cam and it's incredibly hard to tell what's happening. Then there's the plot which is insanely generic and unoriginal. It's something we've seen many times before and something we'll see many times from now.Overall, Falcon & Winter Soldier is mediocre.

Besides Anthony Mackie, Sebastian Stan, and Daniel Br\u00fchl, standouts include new characters played by Danny Ramirez, Erin Kellyman, Adepero Oduye and Desmond Chiam. I also look forward to seeing where they take Eli Bradley, played by Elijah Richardson.Kari Skogland's directing style is full of close-ups and interesting shots, which are actually reminiscent of some of those Elizabeth Moss eye shots in Handmaid's tale, but while the style is fresh for the MCU it can be occasionally jarring. There are also some bigger picture issues with how the show deals with representation and politics.

It was fun, showed emotional bits with 'superheroes' and their own problems as well. It was also a continuation of major event of Infinity War and Civil war and how is people all over the world coping up and how the Government is doing. Also, after in Endgame Cap gave Sam the shield, he's batting that inner conflicts of whether living up to it or not. The series started out strong as well. You kidding? That action scene with Falcon was damn awesome!! Also, it ends with Cap being replaced as Sam feels betrayed.2nd episode- Starts good with showing John Walker(new Cap) feeling the same way Sam did but he is made to take the shield by the Government so he has to live up for it. Its good with that things, well this episode took all that things from 1st one out the window and got nowhere with them. New Cap teams for a brief moment with the duo and fights. He's shown to have peak human abilities (without the serum? I dunno) What if he does during the end of the series? Its shown that serum amplifies what's inside of you - good or bad and makes it better and worse. That' s how Captain America and Red Skull got to be who they were. There were political issues with the bank in the 1st episode. Now there are 2 of them. One with New Cap recruited(being white) and Isayah(that's his name I guess). Well, both were handled such a way that they were fine the latter one hitting the nail hard actually that the 1st one. To know there has been a black super soldier and he was tortured and sent to jail for 30 years while Steve was made hero of the nation. The blood samples were taken from him which comes to play on the 3rd episode as well. But its downhill from that. I don't care about those Smashers also that last scene where he \"sacrifices\" WAHT WAS THAT? Cringe!!3rd episode- Its not that WandaVision picked up the pace on its 3rd entry. No, but it didn't reveal anything upto that point. Yeah, 2 times of the same thing for its 1st and 2nd episodes were doing of too much but it kept it mystery and it was justified. It was new and innovative way as well for being a TV show and aligning the story as Old Sitcoms. It could be great but what it did during the finale brought it down. Not talking multiverses or anything but what the show was itself about. It could've been about Wanda taking the town hosta-What am I doing? Talking about WandaVision on Falcon/Soldier episodes? See that's the point. The story has become boring. Getting out Zemo is easy but its a montage so its fun. What does new Cap do? Nothing!! Oh, there's Sharon there? Where's the intrigue? What are we doing? Where are we heading to? The action scene in the 1st episode with the falcon to whatever is now is comparing the CGI from Game of Thrones to CW's Supergirl. The story hasn't picked up the pace and we're in the halfway of the season!! Halfway!!!WandaVision had 9 epsiode people!! Its not like this would be next 1 and half hour 3 episodes from now on! Nope.

Altogether, America's international power and past become stark themes that are better handled {criticized} that I would expect from Department of Defense-funded Marvel. {And yet, is that not why it is so effective?}Ultimately, Sam's message to the Senators / UN personnel tasked with voting on refugee repatriation post-Snap - \"If you ruling classers don't get this stuff figured out, then people are inevitably going to rise up and try to take what is theirs. People like Karli, who have nothing to lose, who in their hearts fight for equal parts vengeance and righteousness, and who will thus try to win their objectives by any means necessary. Therefore, from your immense positions of governing power, understand *why* the \"terrorists\" / revolutionaries are rising up to fight, and then - within the systems of power as they currently are - rectify the population's demands before they take matters into their own hands in these ways.\" {i.e. Rational Technocracy before Radical Populism, because populism inevitably flirts with revolution which threatens the whole game!, \"game\" = status quo neoliberal capitalism}. Can't say I agree with the underlying reasoning of everything Sam put down there in that final speech, but I'll be damned if it didn't sound good.

As you'd expect from a Disney funded Marvel show, the production quality is impressive and the production team should be commended for their superb work.The story progresses slowly, but organically, with familiar faces returning to confront a new conspiracy involving super soldiers, taking us to new locations around the world, further expanding the MCU. Unfortunately, the plot suffers from poor writing and (in only 6 episodes) fails to deliver on the initial promise. After an interesting build-up, the show seems to stall before rushing into a premature finale that lacks the drama and tension of the films which preceded it and the final \"reveal\" feels corny and unearned. There are even some truly cringe-worthy moments! To make matters worse, Bucky is relegated to the role of a sidekick and his partnership with Sam is sidelined.The writers also felt the need to keep reminding us that the Falcon is black, needlessly and repeatedly drawing attention to his race, making an issue of something which shouldn't be an issue, in a story where it's largely irrelevant.Chris Evans' portrayal of Steve Rogers was always going to be a hard act to follow, but there were glimpses of his inspirational personalty in some of Mackie's early dialogue which suggested he would grow into the role.

Hopefully,, there will be a 2nd season that is a little less preachy and with a better storyline."}, {"reviewer_name": "nachobb", "date": "11 May 2021", "text": "The Falcon and the Winter Soldier contains its fair share of flaws, yet it is surprisingly entertaining.Certain issues include wokeness, described as forcefully introducing sociopolitical issues into viewers faces while trying to escape reality and find entertainment in fantastic stories about people with super abilities.Acting was really good, especially the character of Isaiah and Bucky resisting Zemo's trigger code.Best character in my opinion: John Walker. Why? The progression of his character is intriguing, as well as his choices and perspective of the world. Lemar's death was tragic and surprising, and the moment where John murders the terrorist was exciting; his character also reflects wanting to perform good actions yet being restricted to performing them to a certain extent.The dialogue could require certain polishing, for it comes off as incorrect in certain lines.Another reason I enjoyed the show: Zemo. He has impressive meme potential and is very witty and remarkable with his character, and the final scene with his butler was badass.Villain: Carly wanted to help people, but turned out harming them even more. The thought of a villain thinking they're doing good actions and instead are causing mayhem is terrifying, which makes a villain entertaining to a certain degree. A villain sometimes can use a sense of empathy, for when the villain is going through tough events across the story you can relate to the pain and understand what they went through to know what caused their main motivation.Carly became an actual terrorist, for she caused damage to the people who don't agree with her point of view. They wanted to portray her character as innocent or misunderstood by avoiding labels such as \"terrorist\", yet they could've delved into some sort of psychological analysis and explain part of her traumas that led her to direct her movement. She could've experienced some sort of scene where she doubts herself and the actions she does, so that way her character evolves and questions herself if she is actually helping her cause, or if she really is behaving like the villains she claim she is fighting against.SUMMARY: The villain performs actions in the same degree of severity as the people she's fighting against. They both violate human rights and harm people who are against her actions. For a drama, the villain usually requires a story to explain their origin, because performing negative actions without a valid reason is labeled instantly as being a psychopath, which results in her motivation worth more than herself and everything around her.*Final answer: Shows realistic events that tend to happen in real life, but turns out to be unrealistic with certain scenes and actions executed during the series. Could've used more episodes to develop the story more and have more writing regarding both the protagonist's and antagonist's story, for it felt incomplete in certain occasions.*"}, {"reviewer_name": "tsidney", "date": "8 May 2021", "text": "Besides my ambivalence towards the show, what really peeves me is the terrible sound.

Sam Wilson/Falcon (Anthony Mackie) turns down the shield but instead of retiring it, the authorities make American hero soldier John Walker (Wyatt Russell) the new Captain America. Bucky Barnes/Winter Soldier (Sebastian Stan) can't understand why Falcon turned down the job. Meanwhile, the blip returnees are being marginalized by the world due to legalities and resource limitations. Karli Morgenthau leads a group of revolutionaries called Flag Smashers. Sharon Carter (Emily VanCamp) is hiding in the underworld of Madripoor.This is a six episode Marvel TV show and probably a limited series. It's meant to lead to a new Captain America movie with Sam Wilson. It's also doing a lot of other things and they are a mixed bag. First, this is about a black man taking over the symbol of American exceptionalism. It hits on that present-day issue hard. I do wonder if it could turn off some people who like the color red. I also do wonder if Falcon is walking that line correctly. In the end, the writers are obviously trying very hard with his climatic monologue. That speech goes on too long. It needs a rewrite and cut in half. What really hits home more is the museum exhibit of Isaiah Bradley. The other story lines are just as ripped from the headlines. John Walker is the cop who goes too far. Karli is some sort of Antifa. It's all a maelstrom of modern day politics. I can see this being off-putting but comic books have often tackled the politics of its days.There are undeniable problems with this show. I don't think Sharon Carter works in this role. There may be some rewriting going on and she struggles to go along the journey. Emily VanCamp is fine as Sharon but not the Sharon doing this premise. She is trying to be Hayley Atwell in Peggy Carter but that's not her. The other problem is Karli and her story. Her character needs help introducing her side and her people. The show simply doesn't have the time to fill out her story. The show is about six hours or about three Marvel movies. Even with that space, this show feels jammed together at times especially when a quarter is filled with cinematic action scenes. I have to think that the COVID disruption also caused some of the problems. At the end of the day, it does the main things well. Falcon and Winter Soldier are a good pairing. Falcon's journey to become Captain America is terrific and is given real world meaning."}, {"reviewer_name": "Elewis1195", "date": "25 April 2021", "text": "Where to begin. Bad writing. Plot devices and too much talking.Bucky's story could have been very compelling. He remembers and has to deal with all the stuff he did as the Winter Soldier. This could have been a central theme, but he didn't get enough screen time.Falcon's arc wasn't quite as interesting, but still potentially good. He had to decide he was worthy to carry the shield. That was actually done pretty well and it concluded with episode 5 when he got the shield back.I really wanted to like this, but it had a weak conclusion. Some good bits with Falcon taking on a helecopter, but overall, a weak climax with a long speech after the fight that could draw comparisons with Wonder Woman's \"recant your wish\" speech or Supergirl's \"hope\" speech. 10 for politics, but 2 for story. It just didn't work and I'm happy to see a lot of bad reviews have made it here. This was not a 7.7 show, it was a 5 or 6.There were good bits. There were some nice fight scenes and parts of the series were quite fun to watch, and Falcon's training Montage was Rocky-esq in it's inspiration, but as a whole, it was pretty forgettable, and it tried to do too much at times.The villians generated no sympathy. Isiah Bradley was good, but had little screen time. It feels like this was just a general idea - lets make the Villiams be this, the Falcon has to deal with being black and poor - which felt unrealistic given that a phonecall to Pepper Potts and she'd have paid for the boat and Bucky has nightmares, which was realistic, Insert several fights, but tie it all up in a bow, with no tension or suspense in the end.There was one line, that I felt, could have been the heart of the series, when Baron Zemo said to the Falcon \"Have you visited the memorial\". It was his wife and family who died when Ultron's city fell to the ground. It was a touching line, more touching than seeing Bucky murder an innocent and have nightmares about it. I think there was a good series in there, but what we got just didn't work. It needed to go back to the editing room and have a full rewrite.All that said, it wasn't awful. It was just bad. Worse than most of the Netflix Marvel series and Disney needs to aim higher than that or people will lose interest.

As for the person saying we didn't watch it... 2 action pieces? The first one lasted 11 mins in the air with the michael bay-esq explosions. 11 mins is a pretty big \"piece\"On to the review... After the surprise that was Wandervision I was expecting something more daring from Disney and Marvel... Alas they have resorted to the marvel of old. If you have watched MCU or any of the Netflix series you have seen this. Huge budget with all the money going on special effects and the steroids for the main protagonist to keep \"buff\" ... The only thing more boring than the direction is the story. As for the script... Jesus Christ is it bad.This is the type of show that The Tick lambasted. The type of schtick that Doom Patrol pokes fun at. This is everything those outside of Marvel and DC fans say the two companies are.As for the show... I am not sure who it is aimed at... Wandavision felt like it dealt with more serious topics and tried to do so in an adult way without it being an adult aimed show... This however is meant to be TV-14 yet it feels like it was made for an 8 year old boy.I tried to give it a go but given so many comic book adaptations have shown up the MCU... Doom Patrol, Resident Alien, The Tick, etc... Marvel makes awful movies. Their TV shows now ape their movies, as do their comics and the animations... Well... I aint a DC fan (I prefer the likes of Image, DH, etc) but they are winning in TV (Arrowverse has lasted longer than any series of Marvel shows, and Doom Patrol is killing it imo), They are winning animated by miles, with the new Justice League Dark series of animated features wiping the floor with anything marvel has put out in 20 years. Then there are the comics... Sorry but even with the new 52 DC stills is miles ahead of Marvel. And that isn't me saying \"DC is the best\" ... They really really really aren't.I have not put any spoilers and don't want to but there is some dude on here claiming we are all idiots (\"Pretty sure Some of the idiots in here\") ... Okay may I ask why the capital s? And on. You are ON the internet, not in it. Maybe you feel \"emotionally connect with them\" because the characters are as dumb as you? No. I shouldn't resort to being petty.. You liked the show and good for you. I am sorry we aren't as smart as you. If we were I am sure them would \"feel emotionally connect with them\" .. But alas we are idiots that simply don't have your brainpower. This show must be like Richard and Mortimer. Only IQ 1000 people get it. I feel so sorry for us idiots thinking its all action with the first 11 mins being all action in the air as we watch falcon fly about above the gulf, dodging rockets and trying to rescue someone before entering Libya which isn't a no fly zone just that people should avoid it. And that is due to civil war and what has been going on in Tripoli... So not just egregiously bombastic in tone but also completely insensitive when it comes to facts and geo-politics... But as I said, I am just an idiot and don't have 1000 IQ. I also don't watch Rick and Morty, I don't think End Game is the best movie ever, I've never dressed up as something from Lord of the Rings and ive never threatened to hack someone over PSN or Xbox live because they were better than me at a game...

Throughout this there are some fairly explicit commentaries on racial divides in America and America's policies towards the outside world. Most of it is done very well aside from one ridiculously over-the-top speech in the final episode.Sam and Bucky just about carry the show as lead characters, but the best moments for me involve other characters such as John Walker, Isiah Bradley and one villain previously introduced in an MCU movie.The visuals as you can imagine are spectacular, with impressive looking effects and hyperkinetic action sequences.

Sabastian Stan and Anthony Mackie have a good chemistry, but some of the \"buddy\" banter between them in the early episodes feels quite forced. For me this is down to the material and not their performances. Stan is actually quite excellent in the more emotional scenes. Carl Lumbly has some brief but superb moments. Wyatt Russell, who quite scarily resembles both his mother and father, gives for me the most memorable performance of the show. My only disappointment was Erin Kellyman who doesn't really have a powerful enough presence for the role she is cast."}, {"reviewer_name": "grasshopper1985", "date": "23 April 2021", "text": "Sebastian Stan, and Anthony Mackie can be fun sometimes. And also, Wyatt Russels Captain America/US Agent was pretty great. He was the only reason i might consider watching whatever comes next, but that's a big if.Everything else is just terrible. The plot is a mess, the world is also a mess, and the constant melodrama, filler, and political pandering is almost unbearable. To top that, every single villain in this series can be, and in fact was killed by normal firearms, held by ordinary people. I guess that's why no other hero bothered to show up. When in the Finale Sam said he called in backup, and it turned out his backup wasn't War Machine, Ant-Man, or even Hawkeye....but Sharon Carter...?Also, since when was bucky a super soldier? Maybe i missed something.Anyway, this is bad. The fight scenes are kinda ok, but everything else is just boring.

Though it is literally all about Falcon. Very little development happens with any other characters. Also, if you're expecting this to be like Winter Soldier...its not. Sharon Carter, Zemo, and Winter Soldier are all wasted, and are used as background characters to further Falcons storyline to becoming Captain America. Sharon Carter and Winter Soldier had almost nothing to do in the final battle because the show was so concerned with showing off Falcon as the new Captain America. Falcon has now become some saviour who is now basically Iron Man and Captain America mixed together. Also, a good half of this show is really forced \"woke\" preaching.

This raised my hopes for next entry of the fourth phase of the MCU. Unfortunately, I was extremely disappointed. There are well directed fighting scenes, creators touched many delicate topics, but characters are pretty average: no one really stand out. The spotlight is mainly on The Falcon, The Winter Soldier is just a supporting role, and honestly does not take much screen time. I wish screenwriters developed him deeper, telling more details about his past, and how he became the person that he is today. Unfortunately movies did not managed to do this properly, in my opinion. The show was the perfect opportunity to really exploit him at the maximum.The series treats many interesting topics, however sometimes I have to admit that is too political. The speech of Falcon on the last episode contains a few interesting points, but I did not like at all how he pictured Flag Smashers. Motives of the group are in some extents noble; the leader just wants the best for humanity after the blip, contrasting unfair decisions by the UN Congress. Still their actions most of the time are unjustified, so I would call them terrorists, without any regrets. Disney wanted to give a different perspective, but I was not convinced. They could definitely use some political background, but this feels forced.Titling this series just \"The Falcon\" would be fairer to be honest. It is a generic production that wanted to be something more, but cannot deliver. Action and editing are very neat, but nothing extraordinary.

Instead it gets sidelined with the main characters walking endlessly in circles hunting down a toothless threat and one-dimensional 'villains'. Even more egregiously, it turns one of the MCU's strongest protagonists and genuinely terrifying threats into a comedy sideshow brimming with tropes. It fridges its female lead for the betterment of the male heroes, squandering all her potential, to the point where you forget she was ever actually billed to appear in this show in the first place.

Those saying Marvel are running out of money must be watching something different.The friction between Bucky&Sam and John Walker has created a complex storyline where it's not just 'heroes' teaming up to fight the bad guys, and the whole 'bad guy' thing is unclear too with the good motives behind the destruction.

I can agree with some other reviews that it has a bit slow and boring set up at the beginning. With the 'new Captain America and all serum idea, I got a glimpse of HBO's \"Boys\", and let me tell you, that the \"Boys\" has a much better storyline and the essential darkness to it. Thanks for the R rating (looking at you Disney).With that's been said, I do think that the show is too short and feels a bit rushed after a certain point, almost like the final season of Game of Thrones - multiple ideas, dramatic tension with Bucky's mental health and sense of guilt, Sam's struggles as a superhero with fading fame, which doesn't help him(sister) get loans and, I assume even pay bills. This is a very interesting approach we never saw in MCU before, with a nice hint of darkness and reality.Then we have that 'new' guy, who might become/be a nice villain, but his character feels just rushed on top of all of that group of super-soldiers who fight for justice and go against the system. And don't forget about agent Carter, who plays double game here!I think it's just too much for six episodes! They don't tie together very well, and we were just briefly introduced to each one of them, which is a big minus.The performance and visuals, on the other hand, are amazing, and it's a shame it goes to waste with the lazy writing. I don't regret watching it, though!I see many people complain about shoved in politics. I personally don't see that as a problem, a bit annoying - yes, but again I feel that the racism topic could be done much better if they could focus on few stories instead of trying to fit 10 of them.

Much, much, much has occurred since then. Captain America, emphasis on \"America\". Emphasis on the end of Captain America in Avengers: Endgame continuing to WHO Steve Rogers gave the Captain America Shield to!!! In reviewing, that's how I see this and it is a good continuation.(But don't worry Steve Rogers Captain America fans, there WILL be a starring series for him on Disney too. So just CHILL!!!)Political? Come on, you bet. Seeing some other characters appear from the films to blend in (or possibly end) their story lines, you bet! And the Falcon - what happens to him is an awakening that (to me) makes sense based on the ending of Avengers: Endgame. I don't know if that is in the comic - but who cares. It had film continuity. Disney owns it now, and that is the way they chose to continue. It's not the end of the world. It's entertaining.There is a tad from the comic book world with the New 'government\" Captain America, and it's done well in this blending. But make no mistake, the decisions made are of \"the now\", and many are bad decisions for everyone. People come out of the dark with their own agendas, etc. It's exciting whats going to be next.I like it's in real time, or reflective of such. I hate the term \"woke\", this is not woke or \"forced political\", it's definitely not \"patriotism is dead\" or anything of the sort. How terrible to think so! I didn't see any of this in this Disney series.It's Captain America or America(s) today. I commend the series for hitting that. And..it's Captain America as a third player here for obvious reasons in Season 1.While watching, remember this: It's called the Falcon (Sam Winters) and the Winter Soldier (Bucky). WHat happens is...the government steps in and makes Captain America not what we'd like him to be. And the government picks the wrong guy. That's what this is about.Government issued Captain America is not the star here, but is important as he is cocky, young, hotheaded, self-centered. Is that to be how America is seen? And I'ma guess, it shouldn't be, and (spoiler) it won't be (and that's going to be good part because I love Captain America. I just didn't like this government issued one, as heartbroken as he is of which I understand).Everyone here is trying to figure out their places in today's times -- especially with Terrorist Karli gathering her minions in the background, and yeah, I don't like her either. Interesting, let's see where this goes.Good show, has room to move, I can't wait to see where it goes in Season 2."}, {"reviewer_name": "bishalbasnetnepal", "date": "9 April 2021", "text": "It's an amazing show. If you are a true MCU fan then no doubt you will enjoy the show. Great characters with awesome storyline.

Marvel didn't just throw it away because it is just a tv show. It has a quality of a movie and a great story. It has really well action sequences like in the movies. What I have said also applies to the visual effects. Character development was extremely good. We had seen many characters' changes throughout the series: Falcon, Bucky, John Walker, and more. Every episode was great on its own. Although, it did not make me feel excited about the next episode as it did in the Wanda Vision. There wasn't really much of a mystery in the series; that's why maybe I didn't get excited that much. I did not also fully understand the goal of Flag-Smashers. Like, they're talking about change and migrants all the time, but it would be better if they made it clear. It made an early ending, in my opinion. I would really like to watch more. There was also a Star Wars-like celebration at the end of the series. I didn't hate it, but I also wouldn't prefer it to be that similar. To sum up, this series changes many things for the MCU. It was also a great mini-series that you would probably have a lot of fun while watching. It also has some extreme scenes, but I do not want to give any spoilers."}, {"reviewer_name": "postolachivalentin", "date": "23 April 2021", "text": "If you watched Wanda Vision and love the MCU is still not so easy to recommend this one. The comparison with WV is the obvious one, but already at the second TV series from Marvel the quality has dropped a lot.From the trailer it seemed this could have been a cool mix of Captain America and a Mission Impossible, instead is just a lame story with the characters you know from the MCU.So starting from the story: it's lame even for MCU standards. General bad girl try to do what she thinks is good, but with bad means, so superhero is angry and has to stop her.Also half of the seriest is directed to the fact that the Falcon is black, in case you didn't see it yourself from the cover already, and is like the producers took the tweets from the BLM protests and put them directly in Falcon's mouth.Another big difference with respect to WV, is that in WV it's seems like the story is moving on at the end, so when you watch the next movies there will be something new you have to know. In this one instead all you need to know for future MCU movies could be summed up in 30 sec.I don't know how to end a review, so."}, {"reviewer_name": "caller-63536", "date": "23 April 2021", "text": "Disclaimer: This review is valid until episode 5 that's i am NOT keeping episode 6 or further jn mind, only episodes 1-5. Also thanks if you take the time to read all that ihave to say, good day.I extremely dislike the fact that all media have to remind us that a person is black and it makes a huge difference that he's black. In this show, they feel the need to keep reminding us that sam wilson is a blck person, and like okay? Is that supposed to make us feel better about him as a character? I dont like the fact that they lean so much ob the problen of rasc***. Its 2021 god why do they assume that we care that hes black? At one point of episode 5, the old super soldier says \"they erased me, my history\" and continues on to say \"but they've been doing this for 500 years\" as a white person i get offended by this, because ironically enough hes being rasc*** by suggesting that all white people are the same, categorising us like we're the same JUST BECAUSE OF OUR SKIN COLOR THATS RASC***. Then after that he says \"They will never ler a black man be Captain America\" man hold up. Is this a joke? He's acting as they dont have rights! He's acting as there are no powerful and influencel people in today's society. Its ridiculous!Now to get back on the other smthing he said: \"but they've been doing this for 500 years\" this is inaccurate, the US didn't officially exist until 1776, is he talking about Europe i dont know not sure, from my knowledge i apologize if this is incorrect but slavery was rare to non existent in Europe, which is where im from.To summarize, falcon and the winter soldier is making it obvious that they're trying to tell do something positive but it comes out as rasc*** and hypocrisy in my opinion. The rest of the show is until now pretty good, nothing too special overall average, descent acting, good fights, and interesting plot. The only BIG downside is the villain and john walker(I'll get to that later). I believe they're trying to make us feel sympathetic about her but really she doesn't have any good points. She claims that the world doesn't accept them and that they're trying to survive. There are other ways to survive even when the world bring you down to your knees, no need to hurt innocents and to steal, so in summary the villain is somewhat less intelligence so to say.So the new captain America. He's good and he's rightful in what he does and stands for. But the show is trying to make us feel like hes the enemy? Im not sure right now, i think they needed to keep him on the good side and not turn him evil just because why not.That's all i got to say about it hopefully it will get better, and hopefully it helps you to understand what's the show like. Please don't take anything i said to heart its just what i think."}, {"reviewer_name": "sambowers-38647", "date": "16 April 2021", "text": "This is a really bad show. It's biggest problem is the writing, particularly in regards to the plot, characters, and themes. It's amateurishly scattered and unfocused in almost everywhere (extending to the filmmaking; why so many angled close ups? The only good fight so far has been Sharon's, who I hoped to never see again anyway). I've watched 5 episodes and I can't tell you what's happened in them. The show is mostly quiet, with so little character interaction in favor of silent scenes with only music. It's unbelievably boring. It tries to be multifaceted, touching on a lot of issues: like life after the blip (stupid name), racism. But in regards to the first, Marvel is not mature enough to handle discussions on things like bank loans or social security. This kind of topic is only going to be touched on for this show. The movies are never going to focus on this stuff, so overall, in thinking forwards, this feels like a waste of time. Bringing up questions that the MCU doesn't really want to answer. The villains are incredibly childish in a similar fashion to the company that made them, and I just can't take them seriously. They get talked down almost immediately because they're so poorly written. 8 little kids running around Europe? Those are the bad guys? Really?I don't hate the new Captain America guy. I don't know why people do, both without the show and within it. Because he's not nice? He's a soldier. Because he killed someone? He's a damn soldier (and Sam kills dozens of people in the first episode. Are you serious? How can I take non-violence seriously when everyone is a killer). Of course he should be expected to kill people. Again, Marvel is not mature enough for this kind of character, as I feel like in other hands, he could be really interesting. Probably the best of the lot. Within the show, everyone hates him for no reason up until he does kill someone. Sam is really stupid, or at least the show leads me to believe this, as he gets so mad at this guy even though he's the one who made it possible for him to become Captain America in the first place.Racism only really factors into this show in the 5th episode (and the conversation between Bucky and Sam is so out of left field and unearned, it's hilarious). This is incredibly stupid and such a wasted opportunity because of Isaiah. Isaiah is an incredibly interesting character. The entire point of his character is that he was erased from history, banished from being recognized, in large part due to the color of his skin. Ironically, the writers treat him the same way. He's seen briefly in a early episode and then dropped until the latest. He doesn't feel ingrained in the past at all, and like something that was clearly made up right now with no forethought or careful consideration. Why do we see Bucky (who is perhaps the most boring character in this already boring show) killing a young Asian man? That scene seems to be justified by his living near to his father, and being racked with guilt, but it's ultimately pointless. Why not have that flashback be with Isaiah? That way he'd feel more like he's actually a part of this universe, and give more weight to his life, his struggle, and his message. The people that despise this show because it's too heavy on it's talking about race are wrong. This show handles race and racism incredibly poorly, for the same reason why the show is poor in every other way: it doesn't give enough time to it. To anything. Again, it's way too scattered, and feels like it was written by a team with way too many people in it. It doesn't ever focus on anything, and therefore feels I found it to be like watching nothing."}, {"reviewer_name": "centuryerror", "date": "16 April 2021", "text": "First of all the people saying \"it's in the comics, you guys are the ignorant ones\" - the comics were supposedly written in the 1970s and the show happens in today's world. For today's standards (or really any standards so long as you don't change the definition), this borderline racist, I actually don't know what universe the people who are pushing this stuff live in.The whole painting terrorists in a favorable light is also ridiculous, if you kill a bunch of people who weren't really hurting you, you're in the wrong no matter how noble you think your cause is. I was all for robbing banks, but apparently that didn't make the characters virtuous enough at the eyes of the writer, had to go and kill a bunch of people as well.Bucky is ruined. I get the remorse and the depression, but really if I was forced at gunpoint to try and make a more wimpy and miserable character, I'm not sure I could. Such a great actor and such a great character - ruined. Even the arm sucks now.Capitain america: forced as hell - from a perfectly humble character going on to become the villain in the span of 3 short episodes. I haven't seen a lot of shows do a transition like this, this badly.I actually dig the falcon, the whole \"doesn't get any money and can't get a loan\" arc is completely ridiculous, but aside from that he seems like a balanced person. It's fairly weird to seem him go on fist fights and swing his wings at people every so often, the melee combat really doesn't make a whole lot of sense, but I guess that's just the falcon. I really do hope he doesn't get brainwashed into also blaming everything on white people.This last episode (s01e05) was the hardest to watch yet, more race bs, and ultimately just almost no progression (or didn't feel like it anyway). Imma keep watching because I have nothing better to do while I eat that one meal a week, but if loki turns out to be some more racist garbo or they also make all the characters all wimpy or they pull another \"super hero has no money and can't get a loan type\" level thing - I might just quit marvel entirely.I give it a 5 cuz the falcon is cool, Bucky's actor does a good job despite playing a horrible character, Zemo (and his arc) is dope as hell and so is the CGI.Honestly when I think about it they could just delete all the other stuff from the show and it would probably be better.Yeah, do a version of this where you're not trying to prove that you're virtuous because you believe in easy mainstream politics and you'll probably have me hooked, then I might reconsider docking from this bay I'm sailing. Otherwise this doesn't deserve my money and I'd be fine just not watching in the face of a lack of better options."}, {"reviewer_name": "therealillori", "date": "13 April 2021", "text": "Episode 1: Opens with a decent action scene for Sam followed by a frankly ridiculous scene where a banker turns Sam down for a loan then fawns all over him. But we get it, finances are difficult for people who were blipped. We get to see Bucky dealing with his past trauma in an and out of therapy as he attempted to make amends for his history as the Winter Soldier. His interactions with Yori are the highlight of the episode, so it's a real shame that that actor is only credited with 1 episode, because that story thread felt unresolved. Slow start, but ok, they are setting things up, WV started slow too. 5/10Episode 2: Bucky is upset Sam gave up the shield, follows Sam on a mission he wasn't invited to and is upset when there is no plan. The deadly assassin that went toe-to-toe with Captain America gets beat up by untrained super soldier newbs. John Walker, with no super powers, jumps in and saves the day, showing up Bucky and Sam. For seemingly little reason, Bucky decides to visit a man that only met him as an enemy to have a friendly chat, only to get no information whatsoever, surprise. The visit began too abruptly and ended too abruptly. I assume this was just to set up Eli for the Young Avengers later and to explain where Nagel got his hands on super soldier DNA later on. Police materialize out of thin air just to be jerks. They could have at least suggested that someone called because they thought Isaiah was being harassed. My husband grew up in Compton and never found a cop this easy. We're lucky where we are now if they show up within 8 hours of a crime being reported. But sure ok, they pop up or of nowhere, harass Sam then arrest Bucky, who clearly needs an appointment reminder app on his phone. Bucky and Sam are roped into couples therapy, because reasons. Why? Pacing is terrible and abrupt this episode. 3/10Episode 3: \"Let me walk you through a hypothetical scenario.\" Ha! Bucky assists Zemo in breaking out of prison. Little too easy, but hilarious, so I'll give it a pass. Field trip to Madripoor. Bucky gets in a fight and actually kicks some butt, better. Sam is a terrible actor and I'm embarrassed for him. So, did Sharon shoot Selby? How did a bounty go out within seconds? Let's not worry about that, helpful Sharon has contacts and info. Zemo dancing, yes. They track down the serum creator and find out there is no more. Zemo saves everyone from the dilemma of what to do with Nagel, because he just would have made more if they left him and if they took him it would have been kidnapping as there is no suggestion he was wanted for anything and he would have just ended up making more for the US gov anyway one they knew he could. Fist fights, gun fights and explosions follow. Sharon is very sus. I'm watching you, Sharon. Karli blows people up, because nothing says \"we're the good guys, for the good of the people\" like violence and murder. 6/10Episode 4: Flashback: Ayo speaks the Winter Soldier's code words to confirm that Bucky is free. Heartbreaking crying ensues. Current day: Bucky might be off Ayo's Christmas card list for breaking Zemo out. She agrees to give them 8 hours, them she'll be back. They find Karli and Sam wants to try reasoning with her.

By far the best thing about this season is Anthony Mackie and Sebastian Stan's chemistry as The Falcon and Bucky Barnes. Every scene the two shared together was fun to watch, and the arcs of both their respective characters developed in a meaningful manner that brought closure to the life-changing events in movies like Avengers: Endgame. Other characters I loved were Baron Zemo (Daniel Bruhl), a character who is far more interesting here than he ever has been, and even John Walker (Wyatt Russell) is also a fascinating character even though his arc feels a bit rushed near the end.The show also delves into the complicated political realm of today in the last two episodes, especially talking about The Falcon's identity as a Black man and what that means for someone trying to step into the shoes of Steve Rogers, and I thought the writers handled it as well as they could have in six episodes. However, when it comes to politics, there are some aspects that don't quite pan out; specifically the villain characters, known as the Flag Smashers. This group, as menacing as they may sound, has such a justified reason for existing that I never saw them as villains, yet the show always presents them as an entity to be destroyed. This seemed a bit short-sighted, and the show never seemed to know what to do with these characters, so they aren't given much of an ending.THE FALCON AND THE WINTER SOLDIER is yet another bingeable and fun superhero show for those who want it that provides enough subtext to keep people looking for something deeper happy until the next MCU entry.

The in universe characters widely became aware of this fact in The Avengers (2012). From knowing that aliens exist, to having half of the universe wiped out of existence and to then have them all come back in an instant five years later seems to put things such as race and borders into a whole new light. Frankly in this universe they are irrelevant. Surely eleven years on from the first wide scale discovery of aliens the planet would have united as a collective and realized that they have much bigger problems to deal with. If this series was released before the events of The Avengers (2012) I could completely get behind the struggles that a Black Captain America would face in society as well as the border issues. But due to the fact that this series was released in a universe that widely knows of the existence of alien life and has done for over a decade makes me struggle to get behind the message. Even though it is a solid one at that. It seems more of a message that fits with our current world state and not that of the MCU. I understand why it was included, but sadly its a huge immersion killer. Maybe I'm wrong and eleven years of in universe time is not long enough to erase all of that history in the publics eyes. Personally I like to think that in our darkest hour that humanity would bind together as one. Maybe that's too na\u00efve of me.Overall the show is good not great, definitely not a must watch for the future of the MCU.

It's just that it happens early in the season, so people get hung up right away.While I do agree the biggest such scene isn't very believable, it's super common for shows to force drama into the script. This is only a problem because it's includes a racial issue, even if it's a real issue people experience? You know what's more unbelievable? 99% of hero's in film being white men. Do you also complain about that?It's not even about the fact that there is a message that's a problem. These weak-minded people never take issue if the agenda is starving children or sex trafficking.

At best, these long form stories go deeper than cinematic predecessors. At worst, they are anemic cash grabs to prop up a new streaming platform. They know that if they wrangle subscribers early on, and advertise content in the pipeline (releasing logos for shows they haven't even staffed yet) shareholder happiness awaits.Ain't nothing wrong with storytelling as a business, because good storytelling will never be scarce. However, the fact that we are seeing MCU characters inhabiting CW quality writing and production (at times) should be disconcerting. The MCU flourished through a volley of quality writing which persistently advertised future content without ever failing to deliver on IP expectations in the moment. Not once from 2008-2019 did we live in the future of the MCU, accepting whatever was in front of us. We were in the moment, with our characters.We have crossed over into an era of living for the future (now advertised to be much bigger in scope/characters than phases 1-3), in which there is little incentive to keep \"things\" great, because there are now enough \"things\" to keep busy.We are transitioning from being told stories to simply consuming content, the fine China swapped for paper plates. Passing the threshold of sustainability, it is clear that if the MCU magic does evaporate one day, it will take years of healthy returns before the makers acknowledge it.And you know what, they deserve all the money in the world for giving us a generation of high quality pop culture. I'm just not going to pay a monthly subscription to watch treasured characters from my 2010s fade away, and I hope they know there are many of us who feel that way, and us leaving heralds something more significant for viewership. I assume they are prepared to fill our void with young viewers, the young avengers in the pipeline.In tech-visionary style live unveilings, Kevin Feige and Co have advertised expansion, but it might be a Trojan horse for deflation if this teetering at the top turns to a tumble. The best days of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, and perhaps superhero-centric storytelling, could very well be behind us.

It was super easy to understand. There were few great action scenes and some funny moment.Sebastian Stan and Anthony Mackie was wonderful in the show. The development of bringing Zemo is interesting. I think Marvel was trying to make him comical especially with the club scene which was meme later.The episode four got interesting for me when John Walker murdered a flag-smasher at the end with the shield of Captain America. Episode five was my favorite episode of this show. It started with amazing fight sequence where Sam and Bucky was fighting against John Walker using all of their strenght to get the sheild off of his Super Serum body. But the action takes a back seat whether Sam will be the Captain America or not at a world look at him differently because he is black. And meeting Issah Bradly and learning his tragic history. This is my favorite episode of this show.The journey was fine but once we get in the last episode everything became very rushed and they tried to wrap things up very quickly. And Flag - Smasher as group became a way of excusing John Walker's actions allowing him to team up with Captain America (Sam) and Bucky against them and they forgot everything about John Walker, what he did. John Walker got demoted in a way to US Agent. It was a strange rush.It was the same thing happen with WandaVision. WandaVision also had a intriguing setup and then everything rushed to a conclusion as quick as possible with a bunch of fight sequences. Both heros of the both of the shows get a new name and a new costume.Sebastian Stan and Anthony Mackie were perfect for this. We've seen it in their other movies(MCU). The Falcon and Winter Soldier were very good in this series. But I think they're more focused on the Falcon than the Winter Soldier because he's the new Captain America.There was a new Captain America (Later U. S Agent) known as John Walker played by Wyatt Russell was good. In the first 5 episodes you will have a lot of hatred about this character but in the last episode you will love him for one of his decisions. At first I thought he would be the villain at the beginning of this series but I was wrong then. Wyatt Russell, the actor of this character, was a great actor. He has done the character so well with his acting. You will love him after watching this series.The character's name was Sharon Carter, whom you saw in \"Captain America: Civil War.\" The character in the series was interesting. In the last episode you will see a huge glimpse of his identity. The actress in this character was Emily VanCamp, that character was good. And I didn't expect so much from him but still he did his best for this character.There was a Wakandan soldier, Ayo, you may have seen him in Black Panther, Avengers Endgame etc. The Actress Florence Kasumba was good in the series.Karli Morgenthau, the villain of the series, was hated in the series for his work. He died at the end of the series. Actress Erin Kellyman was great for this character.In a country like America there was a tragic story character for being black. He is Isaiah Bradley. His story is extremely tragic and sensitive. His sacrifice for the nation was incredible but the nation could not remember him because he was black. And he said that Sam would not be Captain America because he was black. In this series, the actor of this character, Carl Lumbley, made the character more emotional.Finally my favorite character is Zemo. He was the best character in the series. He was great, funny and comical in the series. He was having fun getting the whiskey out of the house when John Walker and Wakandan soldiers were fighting for him at the time. Zemo's actor was very good. Daniel Br\u00fchl, Zemo's actor of this series was also quite good. He was impressive in this character.Overall, this series is very good for casting, screenplay, cinematography, color grading, visuals and storytelling.

While it is no where near the sheer brilliance of WandaVision, it still is an impressive enough Marvel project. It features the return of two fan favourite characters, Falcon aka Sam Wilson and the Winter Soldier aka Bucky Barnes.The first episode follows Sam and Bucky grappling with real life issues. It delved deeper into Bucky's PTSD and his inability to live among civilians and enjoy his life after the events of Civil War. While I did enjoy the premiere episode, I was rather disappointed by how much screen time Bucky got compared to Sam. I expected them to cross paths by the end of the episode.Like WandaVision, the Falcon and the Winter Soldier knows how to keep the momentum going and make the audience tune in every week. By the end of every episode I wanted more.The premiere episode opens up with an amazing fight sequence. The episode was rather light on action, but the opening scene makes up for it. Sam and Bucky are being portrayed in a whole new light. At the end of the 6-part mini series, they became more fleshed out and characters I cared more for.Two recurring plot points of the series were each Bucky and Sam related. Throughout the course of the series, Bucky is grappling with his past mistakes, while Sam is trying to save his family's legacy.WandaVision will always be a Marvel project that stands out from the others. The Falcon and the Winter Soldier delivered a great premiere episode and stayed fairly consistent throughout its run, but does not have this unique quality to it that WandaVision encompasses.The season finale was not at all what I envisioned. While it did wrap up the overarching storyline, it felt a little underwhelming. For instance, Karli Morgenthau's death was quite anticlimactic. I kind of expected a big resolution to her story.The Falcon and the Winter Soldier season finale revealed Sam's new suit which is an amalgamation of Falcon and Captain America. I personally find it amazing and so visually pleasing to look at. I still prefer Scarlet Witch's outfit to Sam's new costume.To conclude, one of the main reasons that the Falcon and the Winter Soldier works is the actors Anthony Mackie and Sebastian Stan's performance as Sam and Bucky respectively. They share great chemistry together and their back and forth banter is one of the highlights of the series. The Falcon and the Winter Soldier benefits from its high production value, great fight choreography and jaw- dropping action sequences.

(Cap gives both sides a reality check at the end, it was great)Not too right not too left, they actually went for a centred view calling out both sides. (They basically fought Antifa, and the government) It's the perfect time for this series.It's so refreshing to watch a Marvel show that is actually trying to make me care about it's characters (or as another user put it \"One episode gave Sam and Bucky more development in 45 mins than in 6 movies\").I thought this was gonna end up being another snowflake take , that ruins the characters and universe with characters of no substance and and diversity for the sake of diversity instead of boring characters with no flaws, meaning or intent behind it like Marvel has been moving towards lately.. (Looking at you Captain Marvel Misandrist.)Instead we get rounded characters with depth, real personal struggles, redemption arks and a villain with a misguided view, that went too far, and couldn't realise what she was doing contra what she wanted to achieve, the perfect ending would have been that we see their internal struggle after she's talked to cap and then later fought him again, whilst he refuses to fight back.We do see some of the characters frustration, and confusion while she fight's. (She deeply needs him to fight back so she can get the final confirmation that she needs.) But instead, he tries to talk to her and let her know that he's ready and willing to help her find a way, but it was too late.I honestly hope we get more grounded movies and series, it was nice to remember a time when we still had movies with good characters with depth and good character arks.It had it's flaws, but overall it was great.To the new cap, and better story telling.Thank you, Marvel."}, {"reviewer_name": "mariekv", "date": "24 April 2021", "text": "Bravo to Anthony and Sebastian.

They tried to frame it as a parallel to Israel-palestine, or syrian refugee resettlement, and then clumsily brought in issues of being black in america...but the infinity saga is really not built to meaningfully tackle these issues.The writing is really poor in the first few episodes as well, and that really doesnt help. Conversations seem to go nowhere. Falcon offers a pardon to a character for help, the character takes offense to using livelihood as a negotiating tactic. Falcon then relents and offers to try to get the pardon anyway, then the character says she doesnt want charity and will help in exchange. What was even the point?! There are so many examples of these small, pointless conversations that seem to waste time, early on.

Steve is still 'my' Cap (Chris Evans is just impossible to follow), but that's not to denigrate in any way Anthony Mackie who IS excellent and is a superb actor and character, but I felt this in the books too - Steve is Cap, Sam is the Falcon - overall an excellent addition to the MCU.

People say everything moves to quickly; it doesnt make any sense because in the movies the storylines also have to move quickly with less time..\nThis show is great and gives us finally more insight of bucky and sam or that it particullary isnt easy to be an avenger.People saying it is stupid that they bring race in this series cleary dont live in that kind of world? Because it still happens now a day which makes it more realistic...\nAnd it is also in the comics so..Also the storyline is just great and also amazing how they team up with a former enemy especially for bucky just to get justice. Its the trio you never knew you needed in the mcu. The show sets an amazing angle and the duo Sam and bucky are just hilarious because they care for eachother but dont want to admit it. The action is good and it just feels like you are watching parts of a great movie.I love this show and where its headed; i hope they still give bucky and sam the developement of characters they deserve on their own without being always the best friends of Steve.

But being \"too political\" is one of the weakest, lazy criticisms I've heard. A character called CAPTAIN AMERICA is inherently very political, and the main storyline of this show is drawn almost directly from the comics; so please spare me with the \"there goes Disney pushing a left wing narrative again.\" I found the storyline involving Isaiah Bradley and Sam to be very touching and it has a satisfying, uplifting conclusion that almost brought tears to my eyes. Sure, some of the lines and commentary is heavy-handed and a bit forced and one more rewrite could/should have been done, but in no way was it a major turnoff.Positives: Anthony Mackie and Sebastian Stan are awesome as a duo and have terrific chemistry. I really liked the character development that both of them get as they navigate a new world without their good friend Steve Rogers. I also loved the way Wyatt Russell portrayed John Walker and am looking forward to what's in store for him in the future. Zemo made for a fantastic side character as well. I can't really complain about any of the characters or performances. I think this show does a great job in showing why Sam is worthy of carrying the mantle left by Steve Rogers and that Bucky is far removed from being the Winter Soldier. While Spider-Man: Far From Home and WandaVision didn't, in my opinion, handle the aftermath and ramifications of Endgame in a very realistic way, this show definitely does. There is a nasty political side to the return of half of the planet's population, and this show tackles it in a (for the most part) thorough manner.Negatives: My main criticisms of this miniseries involve the script and antagonists. The finale, while emotionally satisfying, does feel a bit rushed and it could've benefited from about ten more minutes of screentime. By the end of the show, Karli Morganthau is no longer a compelling villain like she was built up to be and becomes just a painfully annoying, unlikable, and unsympathetic character. I would've also liked to see Walker's arc get more time to develop since it also feels rushed. I wish Zemo stayed around a bit longer than he did. I am confused as to what Sharon Carter's plan was the whole time since the (obvious) reveal that she is the Power Broker does add unanswered questions as to what she was doing in the previous episodes.Overall, despite these complaints, I enjoyed TFATWS quite a bit. I do like it a bit more than WandaVision because I found the character motivations and story here to be more grounded.

Sam having financial troubles, need of having some Captain America , Super soldier serum being reverse engineered and a young girl stealing it and starting the chain of events. However by the 4th episode, I have started liking the character arcs, particularly the new Captain America (played by Wyatt Russel) and Sam(Anthony Mackie). Sam is the quintessential idealistic person having the humbleness, patience and foresight where the new Captain America (John Walker) is impatient and ambitious but feels underpowered among super soldier adversaries. Winter Soldier and Zemo are so-so in my opinion, but help to move the plot along. Can't help but feel that Zemo is there as the 'Loki' of this series. On the positive side Action sequences are fantastic, Direction is good.

It gets better with Sharon (Emily Von Camp) and Baron Zemo, Daniel Bruhl just magnificent in his role, with a bit of fun and sexiness.I liked the psychological story arc and how they deepened into the realities of these two heroes' lives: Bucky's troubled past and his struggle for redemption, and their interaction, going from two guys who barely tolerated each other ending up close friends. It had everything to be an amazing show.But then in the last episodes The Falcon is reduced to his skin color and Bucky's importance is diminished. The show previously hinted him as the White Wolf, the leader of Wakanda's Secret Service, to end in nothing. He becomes just a side kick for the Falcon, leaving his talent and skills underdeveloped.And worse, it becomes West Wing with Sam Wilson as President Bartley. The politicization of Captain America, something Steve Rogers always fought against, being even the reason for the \"Civil War\" against Iron Man Stark, becomes the peak of the narrative.We fans watch the MCU and Avengers for fantasy and awe, not as a political documentary. The 4 minute speech by the new Captain America is out of place and full of platitudes. If this hints to Captain America 4 as a political show, I'm out.I still want a Season 2 or another movie for #TFATWS because the two main characters are much more than a political tool, this time focusing on Bucky Barnes/The Winter Soldier/The White Wolf, who was so underused. I hope Sebastian Stan's strong acting skills and Bucky's fascinating story as the Winter Soldier and Wakanda's White Wolf may be better developed and explored in a future project."}, {"reviewer_name": "alphahuntercj", "date": "28 April 2021", "text": "It feels like they tried to cram 3 seasons worth of material into one.

This wasn't falcon and the winter soldier, this was falcon, the random terrorist, and the soldier who was assigned an insane job and needed back up.

I think it should have stayed away from politics at least not to the extent it does, it makes it a bit boring at times with long scenes of straight dialogue. I think that the heroes are really great in this, especially falcon. His character has an extreme amount of development, whether its backstory, personality or his relationship with bucky. Bucky has only really got development with falcon as he has already been developed across previous movies. As far as villains...they ain't that good. I did actually quite enjoy the US agents character arc, albeit a bit predictable but it was fun. However, anything to do with Carly was just bland, her character is just plain dreadful with no emotion, no epically cool powers or any stand out features. Her motivations are somewhat understandable and suck. Also I don't know what it was but something about her annoyed me, in the wrong way though, maybe it was the accent or bad dialogue but she just seemed fake and everything she said literally turned into a motivational speak about the same exact thing time and time again. Oh and zemo is there also. The action is really strong, there is a bit too many cuts and weird camera angles that stop you from seeing some cool punches which is a bit annoying, if you do see it, it is good. Really the best part was the ending, perfectly sets up future movies/tv shows and has a great speech about BLM to top it off.

Some people on here are complaining about politics and forced \"woke'ness\" (whatever that means) but my issue was more that it just felt inauthentic more than anything. If Disney are going to tell stories about people of color, let those stories be told BY people of color. This show was written and directed by more white people trying to seem progressive and it just came off kind of heavy handed.Additionally, despite this series only being 5 episodes, it still somehow felt like 2.5 hours of actual story stretched over 5-6 to fill a TV miniseries. This left more than one of the episodes feeling like 90s evening television, eyeroll inducing cliffhangers and all. The action sequences are also hit or miss. The first one in the show during episode one was absolutely brilliant, whereas the extended action in the finale somehow felt like a huge step back. Back editing. Bad choreography. Bad action directing (to the point of making some of the scenes actually confusing).Ultimately, anyone complaining about Sam becoming Captain America, or Walker becoming \"new\" Cap and then US Agent CLEARLY need to read up on the actual Marvel comics.

Now, having watched the whole thing, the first episode was probably the best one.My main issue with this series is that it is not what I, as a fan, was promised. It's hard not to compare it to Captain America: Winter Soldier (2014) seeing as the creators of the show invited us to and it is also a continuation of the Cap trilogy, but the plot, the dialogue, the characters and even the fight scenes are not up to scratch.I found Anthony Mackie's Sam Wilson so unbelievably dull that I can't even find something about him that somebody might like. He certainly is not strong enough to lead a series on his own, because, let's face it, this was 90% Falcon, 10% Winter Soldier. And it's a shame - I genuinely believe that Mackie gave his all to the role. The bad writing didn't help but maybe he just isn't the right kind of actor to lead something like this.Whereas I had total faith in Sebastian Stan and I used to think that Bucky was one of the most unique and interesting characters in the MCU but maybe the writers just forgot about him? There was so much potential there and they just didn't do it? Honestly, I feel cheated.I found Zemo quite pathetic, the Flagsmashers forgettable but US Agent was actually okay. I thought Wyatt Russel was the perfect fit for the role and there was such depth and duality to the character which made him a very believable antihero and one I'm actually excited to see more of in other projects.I won't go too much into the political aspect of the show but I'll go as far to say it was a mistake and I didn't like it. I think it was episode 2 where we caught a glimpse of where the story was going before COVID-19 hit and it was better, living up to the hype.

However, Falcon and the Winter Soldier far exceeds WandaVision. The gravity of the show caught me off guard. While the MCU is usually a fairly formulaic \"good guys defeat bad guys\" movie with a good dose of comedy and occasional serious drama, this series represents a huge tonal shift compared to what I was used to. The MCU universe is typically portrayed as something of a picturesque reality where the good guys always triumph and everyone lives happily ever after. Leave it to Hollywood to not accurately represent their source material, and the comics, although they did have good defeats evil themes throughout, the comic writers were sure to write real-world problems into their comics, and that's something that was mostly notably absent in previous MCU entries.Starting largely with Captain America: Civil War, the heroes start having to face repercussions for their actions, and sometimes they're not always forces for good. This idea is represented tremendously in Falcon and the Winter Soldier. Although the heroes saved the day in Avengers: Endgame, there are real-world consequences to suddenly bringing back half of the planet's population after they were missing for five years. In those five years after the Snap, although they were bad, people that were otherwise enemies joined forces, and countries and their people joined together in grief over their lost loved ones and sought to rebuild the world and make it better. The Avengers bringing everyone back essentially returned everything back to the way it was before, and suddenly the same problems that people thought were gone are staring them in the face again: racism is a thing, countries hating each other is a thing again, and it's like the Snap and the five following years, along with all of the rebuilding that came during that time, never happened. The problems portrayed in this series are very reminiscent of real life, something that was lacking in previous MCU entries.The title of Captain America is one with a hugely complicated history, the Flag Smashers are supposed to be the bad guys but their intentions are, at their base, good, and things are very far from being perfect following the actions of the Avengers in Avengers: Endgame. There is so much grey area with morality in this series, I struggle with whether or not I should root for one character or another, and I love every second of it. I highly recommend this to people that enjoy the MCU and wouldn't mind quite a bit of realism poured into it for good measure."}, {"reviewer_name": "arionh-35457", "date": "3 April 2021", "text": "Honestly all of the reviews are wrong this is a excellent show and really cares about its narrative and characters please just go watch it for yourself without all the biases and review hate."}, {"reviewer_name": "Jonathan_Pereira", "date": "10 June 2021", "text": "Had some good moments but the plot was a letdown.

From start to finish, Anthony Mackie's Sam Wilson and Sebastian Stan's Bucky Barnes are finally able to shine without the larger than life presence of Steve Rogers around to stifle them. However, while Sam's character arc in this series, and to a lesser degree, Bucky's, is somewhat fully realized and well-written, many of the characters in the periphery do not get the same treatment. The return of former MCU characters like Baron Zemo and Sharon Carter was exciting to see, but nothing wholly new is added to their developments. New characters like John Walker and Karli Morgenthau exist, more or less, to give Sam a reason to take up the mantle of Captain America by the show's end, instead of standing on their own in a meaningful way. Furthermore, the snap decision to cut a storyline that reportedly saw the Flag Smashers releasing a deadly virus on the world is extremely noticeable, and hurts the series in the long run, leaving plot holes big enough to walk through. This array of issues causes TFATWS, much like WandaVision, to fail in fully sticking the landing in its final episode. And, as many fans of Game of Thrones or How I Met Your Mother know, a good ending is just as important as everything that came before it, and will drastically impact how fans remember the show as a whole.

The show tried its hardest to make Karli and the Flag Smashers seem like this group with a righteous cause but in the end, they came off as annoying with no real purpose besides being in the way of our main characters.Karli has gone down in my books as one of the most lamest villains in the MCU. She is one dimensional with no real character growth at all, she is the same person in the beginning till end. She's just a psychopath, an annoying psychopath at that. Also, WAY TOO OVERPOWERED.However, I did enjoy almost everything else. I liked the Isaiah Bradley stuff, The Zemo stuff and the John Walker stuff but I feel like they could have cut some stuff out.

At first I was annoyed by how the script is so blatant and uses little nuance to get what they're trying to convey. I don't usually like when writers don't let the audience come to their own conclusions and give it to them straight without room for interpretation. But after thinking about it, I realize that this is one of those times where you can't leave it up to interpretation because those who have always seen themselves reflected in media can't understand and basically need this spoon fed to them to try to \"get it\". Of course those who are color-blind every other day their favorite characters aren't portrayed by a black person are probably going to just turn it off when they think it's \"furthering an agenda\" which is ironic because the show literally is about those who wouldnt want a black Captain America.Another thing that people have criticized this show for is how the plot focuses on something as domestic as fixing a boat. But I speak for a lot of us comic fans when I say, YES. GIVE US SUPERHEROES IN DOMESTIC SITUATIONS. You can create fascinating senarios and genuine connection to these characters when the audience gets to see them doing mundane things you wouldn't normally think about superheroes doing. It's sounds ridiculous but just look at fan fiction written around the MCU. Sure, a lot focus on adventures but a lot of them want to explore what it's be like just to go to a party and see these characters interacting and learning about each other. It makes the characters more dynamic when you get to know about their history, likes and dislikes and really what makes them *them*. These little moments gives the audience a kind of intimacy that makes us care more about them.There are other things to criticize this show for like the huge explosion the main characters just survive and walk away from with no explanation and a few plot holes, but I just wanted to defend a couple of their decisions."}, {"reviewer_name": "bob_bayer_rrt", "date": "17 April 2021", "text": "The pain the Winter Soldier is experiencing in the camp fire scene is gut wrenching.

The first couple episodes were like the start to any movie. It established where are characters were - emotionally - and also established the overall arc of the plot. As each episode approached the finale, we see more action, more plot, and more character development. Then the finale hits and it truly feels like an authentic climactic ending of a standard Marvel film. However, the pacing of a couple episodes was a bit slow, and they probably could've cut enough to make it 5 instead of 6 episodes, but I enjoyed it nonetheless.The 5 year blip effected the entire world on such a deep level. We've already seen the aftermath in Spiderman: Far From Home and WandaVision. The Falcon and the Winter Soldier elaborates on the effects a bit more with how the world has recovered rather than just our favorite characters. This is why the main villain, Karli, was so good. Her intentions were understandable, and that made her interesting.In all the time we've known Sam, we've only seen him as the loyal friend and sidekick of Steve Rogers. The first episode gave us so much more about his back story, which we knew almost nothing about prior. While we pretty much know most about Bucky's back story, it was also nice to see how his character developed and how he's recovering from being someone's \"pet psychopath.\" Getting more time with these characters has been my favorite part of the show. Not just because we get to unwrap more of their character, but their dynamic with each other is comedic gold.The Bucky-Sam comedic duo is no doubt the main attraction to any fan here. I can't even begin to explain in words how hilarious they were. The meme economy was booming. For the whole six weeks the show was on, I couldn't even last 2 minutes on social media without seeing some sort of meme about them, or the show in general. You'll find me on YouTube looing up 3 hour funny moment compilations of Sam and Bucky.Going from WandaVision to this, the crave of sick action scenes was satisfied as every episode had at least one super cool fight scene. This was the fun action some fans may have missed, and it was well worth the wait to see.The final episode was epic and is exactly what we've been missing since the last Spider Man movie. Not only did the real Captain America come on to the scene, but he did it with style. Sam is the new Cap, and he owned it. The reveal of his new design was amazing and it lead to fun, action packed, well choreographed fights. An hour of classic Marvel entertainment to be sure.Episode three was a huge turning point because it brought us the wonderful Zemo back on our screens. Zemo is objectively top 3 MCU villains of all time. The idea of him becoming an antihero of sorts and creating this ultimate trio we never knew we wanted made that episode such a highlight. And the image of him vibing in the club lives in my mind rent free.Zemo was probably the highlight of everyone's experience with this show. However, John Walker gave the opposite feeling. Wyatt Russell did a wonderful job with this character. Every viewer collectively hated him when he was introduced, and Russell did a great of continuing that through the episodes. He did not deserve any hate he received at all. I dislike that character as much as everyone else, and even after his little redemption, I don't care about him. But Russell presented some complexities with the character in key moments, and credit needs to be given where it's due.Final thoughts - loved the cast, loved the acting, loved the action. A fun 6 hour experience for all Marvel fans. WandaVision was a phenomena on its own, but it was nice to follow it up with a classic adventure with some favorite heroes (and villain). Anthony Mackie and Sebastian Stan are simply awesome. They gave us many emotional layers to their own characters and have such great chemistry together on and off screen that make us love the duo. If they make a Captain America 4 with these two guys, I'll pre order my tickets for opening night. I'll be so ready."}, {"reviewer_name": "brianklomp", "date": "23 April 2021", "text": "And yeah, u can feel the Disney in there hahaha.For me a perfect match.

Well, the humorous arguments and banter were very minimal (I can only remember one instance), and other than the very first opening scene, the action sequences were nothing special.

If the new cap is just a man (though conveniently according to MIT a pretty good one in the script), how is he jumping from helicopters 20 feet to moving lorries, getting kicked off them onto moving cars without a scratch (though bucky gets a shiner) and throwing the shield with more speed and power than Steve ever did?In ep1 Falcon v batroc the leaper is as even a fight as Steve had with him in winter soldier?\"On your left\" so iconic for the character yet when first used it defined also the difference between cap and Falcon in physical attributes...this in the franchise has been reinforced with cap v bucky, panther v bucky, the chase through cars in civil war, the fight in the elevator between cap and half a dozen highly trained soldiers including crossbones. All undone in 2 episodes. Once you see the rules ignored you can't unsee it and it's contrived, conveniently lazy and really annoying.But I love the characters as long as every scene with our 2 protagonists isn't bad banter..that gets boring after a while.So I gave it a 6...if it was its own show and not MCU it would be less."}, {"reviewer_name": "ggenricquera", "date": "23 March 2021", "text": "It's good but the action is kinda lame.

Somehow we have to shoe-horn in some cops harassing Sam who is literally just standing there talking to someone. Really? The cops have to be bad guys so badly that it's come to this? That's just lazy writing to check someone's box.Production quality of the show is top-notch. Anthony Mackey is a beast, and is outstanding in nearly everything I've seen him in. Amazingly versatile and underused in the MCU. He can portray depth with just a look. Sabastian Stan plays great off of him, and I look forward to seeing more work from him.But the writing is just awful. It's so slanted and distorted that it hurts to watch. Black Female super soldier can commit murder, and she's a victim, male White non-super soldier commits murder, and he's a villain. And, it's an immediate message. There's no misunderstanding. It's really sort of shameful. The comics accomplished more and with much better quality messaging. It really broke my heart to see it.Sam was more brawny and tougher in the comics, but he and Cap set out to really champion what was right - regardless of the cost.

While the previous show, WandaVision, did something new with the Superhero genre, TFATWS aims to bring the Captain America movie style to a TV show format. The premise is \"Six months after being handed the mantle of Captain America at the end of Avengers: Endgame (2019), Sam Wilson (Anthony Mackie) teams up with Bucky Barnes (Sebastian Stan) in a worldwide adventure that tests their abilities and their patience\". So does this series live up to the mantle or drops the \"shield\" completely?Firstly, I like the idea of the series. Having a series focused on Sam and Bucky who for the most part in the MCU movies are just Captain America sidekicks as the main focus for the show is great. Also having the series revolve around the legacy of the shield and Captain America is an interesting idea. They also explore interesting themes such as racism, refugees and corrupt governments while still retaining the core elements of the MCU movies.Sam is the main focus in the show and his struggle with the legacy and the responsibility of the shield is a great story. Throughout the show we see him explore what it means for a black person to take up the mantle and what Captain America means to the people. By the final episode, seeing Sam fully come into terms with his role is very fulfilling. Bucky is the secondary protagonist and he is struggling with his past as the Winter Soldier and a world without his best friend Steve. There is an exploration of his trauma and him trying to do right to all the victims of his past which is a nice story for his character. By the final episode, he finally knows what he needs to do and it's quite sad yet satisfying. The best part of the show is the banter between these 2 and their buddy cop antics are absolute highlights in the series.Another highlight in this series is John Walker played magnificently by Wyatt Russell. He is the new Captain America that is chosen by the government. Wyatt manages to perfectly make him hateable and that is quite the testament to Wyatt's performance. He isn't an outright villain though and they do give him a fair amount of sympathetic qualities with a character arc of sort for him as well. Another great support character is Isaiah Bradley (Carl Lumbly) who has some great moments that add some weight to Sam's story. Zemo (Daniel Bruhl) returns from Captain America Civil War as a sort of wildcard for Sam and Bucky. His return is great as we get to see a more fun side to him while still being quite the manipulator. His interactions with both Sam and Bucky add another level of tension to the dynamic. Additionally, he wears his iconic costume from the comics which is nice even though it doesn't make much sense for him to do so. Daniel Bruhl single-handedly stole every scene he was in thanks to his amazing performance.The cinematography by P. J. Dillon feels very \"movie like\" and I didn't get the TV show feeling when watching the series. There are some parts in the series where the visuals are quite gorgeous with an example being episode 3 where they are in Madripoor. Henry Jackman who scored Captain America Winter Soldier and Civil War returns to score and while none of the soundtracks is memorable, it does a good job in representing the scene without being overly distracting. There are great action scenes that utilize the power of the super soldiers and the flying suit of Falcon. Some fights are quite brutal and very memorable.Nevertheless, I have some issues with this series and the biggest one being the slow pacing. There are a lot of moments where it feels like not much story progression is occurring. This is most noticeable in episode 5 where the majority of the episode is just a lot of sitting around. For a series that is only 6 episodes, it is quite weird that it can still drag like this. There is also a lot of moments during the series where it seems to be more focused on building future stories which are mildly distracting from the main story. The final episode also handles John's final story arc in a really weird way that just feels completely sudden and it also contains a very cringe resolution that doesn't fit the series.I also have an issue with the main villain Karli Morgenthau (Erin Kellyman) who is the leader of an anti-patriotism group the Flag Smashers who contains some members with super-soldier serum. The motive of the group is fine and understandable as they want to have open national borders. The problem is the leader of the group Karli is just not believable. She is extremely bratty and murder crazed that I do not understand how people look up to her. The actress Erin is okay but her performance is constantly outweighed by the better antagonist of John Walker and everyone else. It also baffles me how they are somehow able to fight on par with Bucky when he has literal assassin, military training and a vibranium arm but okay. Sharon Carter (Emily VanCamp) returns but I have mixed feelings about her. She is a lot darker as a character and doesn't resemble who she was in the Captain America movies which are mildly jarring. Her still being on the run from the government despite all the other Cap supporters being pardon makes no logical sense. Despite being blipped, she is also somehow able to build a massive fortune and completely change her personality doesn't feel believable. However, she is a lot more interesting than just being Peggy 2.0 so there is that.Overall, the series doesn't land all its shots but it certainly delivers on the epic scope you expect from Marvel. It has mature social commentary, hilarious moments, thrilling action sequences and great chemistry between Anthony and Sebastian that just meshes together like a charm. I'm interested in what this series leads to whether it's another Marvel movie or a second season and I want to see more of Sam and Bucky in the future."}, {"reviewer_name": "fede4488", "date": "24 April 2021", "text": "When people (conservatives, really) say it's too political what they really mean is \"too progressive for me\".

This should be the central question of the entire mini-series, yet it's never really defined in any meaningful manner.Where is Steve Rogers? I guess he's \"dead\", but with the super-soldier serum? He's gotta be somewhere around to serve as a mentor. Either way, we should see either flashbacks or some form of mentorship from Steve Rogers, but we get nothing. We could've at least had some reflection about how Steve would've handled a situation.Is the Army really so dysfunctional as to put forth John Walker as its best? Here's a guy with the personality of a cadet and the awards of a 20 year veteran. Did Disney only consult with the most jaded of veterans? You could say that one MOH is luck, but by three there should be some enduring and redeeming personality traits showing through. I was waiting for the part where they revealed he was brainwashed into believing he had done great things, but sadly...still waiting.What was the point of the villain again? I know they said her cause was compelling via exposition and all, but what exactly was it again? The measure of a hero is in part measured by how compelling the argument they stand against. It seems our hero is measure against someone who punches things and occasionally blows something up. Brilliant.Where are the endearing traits for Sam Wilson? Having watched Avengers Assembled, I was very excited to see Sam Wilson taking on the mantle of Captain America. In Avengers Assembled, we see a Sam Wilson that is humbled by his acceptance into The Avengers, boyishly relatable by the affections of his mother, and routinely solving complicated problems with an extensive and innovation technological approach. The Sam we see in this series shows none of these traits and just sort of says \"why not me?\".Overall the action was cheap, with a lot of garbage melee and explosions. A few great scenes of CGI seems to be about all they could afford. So many conversations could've been cut, as they reduced to 'well, some talking happened\".Six episodes was entirely too long for this. A few minutes to show the passing of the mantle. Perhaps a few more to show John Walker losing it (in front of a filming crowd, no less). Few more minutes to show Sam's training montage, then bam, straight through the window as Captain America. One episode is all we really need. That scene really was satisfying, but it pains me to have suffered five full episodes to finally get it.Not the worst from Marvel, but definitely a low point.

You're gonna kill someone.\" \"I don't wanna kill anyone, I don't like bullies...\" He appears to be a man who genuinely values human life.Cut to Sam Wilson. I'm not saying he should be like Steve. He shouldn't be; He should be Sam. Sam's character in the MCU has been really good so far. Yes, he has so far been in the shadow of Steve as Captain America. The way his character has been built up in the MCU so far, no one else is more appropriate and deserving of Captain America's shield.The main issue, I find with this series is the plot. The story appears forced towards identity politics especially in the last episodes. The writer have made it apparent and clear that Sam was reluctant to hurt the Flag Smashers not because they are human beings but because he sympathizes or empathizes with their cause / politics because he is in tribe \"Black\" and they are tribe \"Refugees\".This logic may work in real life for some with tribal mindset. But an MCU superhero? We have come to see our superheroes as beyond politics. Just because Sam Wilson is \"black\" in America, he could not rise to the character level and maturity of T'chala (at least the way he was portrayed in his one movie).Also, couldn't they have spent a few more dollars and made a proper costume for Sam?

The Wakandans also felt a bit forced and overall the Zemo plot line was just a setup in the grand scheme of things.The Flag smashers are given a very lacklustre backstory. Their motivations are not clearly explained in the entire series. I believe they have cut and reedited a lot of their scenes. Some speculate this has to do with a cancelled pandemic plot in the show which was too similar to the current global situation. I wanted to take side with them, but the show does little to nothing to develop the flag smashers that they just seem like a vague bad guy with some kind of political cause that is never explained properly. John Walker on the other hand was more of a compelling villain. I loved Wyatt Russell's performance. But I'm kinda mad that they didn't give him much to do in the finale. I'm excited for US Agent though.The show does justice to both the titular characters but it is a bit skewed to Sam overall. Bucky is given less time to shine, but Sebastian Stan nails his performance in those scenes that analyse the winter soldier. My biggest quibble was how they handled Sharon Carter. The reveal that she is the power-broker doesn't make much sense unless Marvel has something planned like making her a Skrull.The show overall has high moments.

Stan has always been great and he gives a really strong performance here, there is so much emotion to the character of Bucky Barnes as he really tries to move on from his past as The Winter Soldier but it provides some stellar scenes and I love both of these characters and felt like they really moved up from supporting characters in the films to main characters here.Supporting Characters\nWyatt Russell plays John Walker and this guy is amazing, I mean the internet literally united to hate this character and that takes an incredibly skilled actor to do that. I actually felt like he was such an interesting and real character that had plenty of depth towards him and you see how he is really affected by the pressure of his new role. Daniel Bruhl is back as Zemo and he is probably my favourite part of the show, when he arrives on the screen the show just gains more life and energy to it with Bruhl clearly loving his role and allowing more freedom the he had in Captain America: Civil War. Emily VanCamp is also back as Sharon Carter and she is really good, they do some interesting things with her character and you see how the past 5 years that the character has had to go through has really affected her more then most. Carl Lumbley plays Isiah Bradley and wow this is such a strong performance, the emotion is ramped up ten fold when he is on screen and it feels appropriate due to the real life issues that are clear inspirations and he knocks it out of the park. Erin Kellyman plays Karli and I think she is okay, the MCU has sometimes had issues with antagonists and I think Kellyman does the best she can and really tries and it doesn't affect the role too much and more of the issue is the storytelling for her and her groups role.Story\nThe story is good, the dynamic between Sam and Bucky is really affective and I love how it develops as the show goes on and progresses very naturally. The show is also effective in showing the legacy of the shield of Captain America and how there is way more then we knew from the films. The show also manages to spend more time with the characters and find out more about there characters and ideals and that is only something this show can do. But there are a few issues and for me it was mainly to due with the villains The Flag Smashers, I think when they wrote them it sounded great on paper but it just wasn't as good as it should have been. The show needed to do more with them and make us actually care about them which they just missed here.Script\nThe script is really good, The MCU has always had a blend of humour and drama but this show does it ever so well. There is a nice amount of laughs and that is mainly due to the chemistry between the two leads. But the drama is really well done with some truly emotional scenes that are made really well and executed in a way to really make you care.Style\nThe style is good, in terms of the action scenes and the scale I thought it was really good. It at times feels like one of the films with action scenes that are huge in scale and feel like they slot in really well with the rest of the MCU. But I do think this show has a few issues with its pacing, there are only 6 episodes but I think it needed at least 8, there are a lot of story arcs going on here and not all of them have as much time dedicated to them as they really needed.Overall\nOverall, The Falcon and The Winter Soldier is a great show that does a great job with its characters. This is just another great addition to The MCU and sets up some pretty exciting things for the future that may affect the TV and Film universes so give this one a watch."}, {"reviewer_name": "cruise01", "date": "26 April 2021", "text": "4.5 out of 5 stars.The Falcon and the Winter Soldier is a really good series. The second series in the mcu. I personally loved it more than Wandavision. It is more fast paced. Action packed. The action is gritty like the second and third Captain America movies. The series focusing on the two characters after dealing with Captain America stepping down with his role. And the aftermath with the blip that has a rebellion group planning an attack cause of the change with the world.Old enemies return with a fun surprise. And new characters are introduced like Walker (Wyatt Russell) who take the series into an interesting direction. Without giving spoilers to plot points and characters. Wyatt Russell did a great job with his role. And i am excited to see more adventures with Winter Soldier and the falcon. And where they may go in future mcu adaptation.The series did have a slow pacing with the last half of the season.

Going into this with no knowledge of the Marvel Cinematic Universe ... I am not sure how this will work out. Going into this with not the biggest knowledge of the comic and its character history but being up to date with the movie world they created ... I know a little bit about that.So this follows what happened after Endgame - I'm assuming you know that or at least have read up on it. Or do not care really - but I will go from there and reference what happened at the end of that specific movie. At least in connection with this tv show. As you can see I take no spoilers really to an extreme and I care about people not getting more information than they bargained for ... talking about getting more than one is bargained for: That is true for the Falcon (not Black Falcon, racial issues will play a role here and I salute Marvel for tackling issues head on and with such grace, style and competence) ... who got the Shield from Captain America, but for some reason does not seem to want to keep it ... we will learn why ... and it is not something to be taken lightly either.It is also something that he can't just blur out when he sees Bucky ... who is quite mad that the Falcon seems to go against the will of the ... now Ex-Cap. So while the Falcon retires the Shield, the question is if the Shield is ready to retire? Or rather the goverment - are they ready? And this is the first of 6 episodes. A great mini series that will bring a few characters besides the two in the title.And the cool thing is they get mostly introduced at the end of each episode (true for Episodes 1-3 ... I guess you could say there is a character reveal at the end of episode 4). There are so many goodies in this show ... and some during the credits. Which as with Wandavision only get into play for Episodes 5 and 6. But in contrast to Wandavision the final episode only has one mid credit scene.

So you have to expect there will be incessant undertones of social justice in every scene. I don't think they even do it consciously anymore. I think it's so ingrained in their being that it's conveyed subconsciously. A conservation with a black kid on the street who says his dad insists his name is Black Falcon. Really? Can we skip the race lessons? He's a military hero. Does his race matter. He speaks perfect English, until he gets around his family. Then he says things like, \"You know I don't play with these white folk.\" Great role model. Throw grammar and anti-racism out the door. Make way for Black Falcon... who apparently is racist when in private. Shameful.But I expected all this. So I ignored it and tried to watch it for the entertainment.Anthony Mackie and Sebastian Stan have great chemistry. And the scenes with Winter Soldier and his shrink are by far the most realistic and well put together. Of course you would expect a bunch of woke writers to nail that... they have a lot of experience with therapists.Where it all falls apart is simple LOGIC. The new Captain America is not enhanced. He's just a normal human with extraordinary bravery... so basically no different than several hundred thousand active duty service members. But they make him trade in his rifle for a mask and shield. His first time out with his black side-kick... again overcompensating with race-representation... they get crushed by some unarmed super soldiers. Four men, working directly or indirectly for the U. S. Military and none of them thought to bring a rifle?As it turns out... that's all it takes. Because in the next scene... our super soldier villains hop in the getaway vehicle... one that can never be caught... a single-engine prop plane. Newsflash... the US has a mere 40 military installations in Germany. We're kind of allies in the war on terror. Do you know how many German and American jets can be scrambled before they make it 10 miles? Instead, they send a convoy of SUVs to intercept the prop plane. Yes... they pinpoint the location of the terrorists to an airport... what do we do??? Obviously... send CARS!!! If only someone had thought of something like... an APACHE helicopter!!! Or perhaps A DRONE!!! OMG!!! They're at an AIRPORT.But it gets worse... because one super soldier decides to sacrifice himself to save the others. He knocks down a utility pole to stop the entire convoy of SUVs... because apparently... they're not capable of driving on GRASS. A few ordinary operators pop out of the lead SUVs and shoot the super soldier dead with standard-issue .556 M4 rifles.Essentially... Captain America, his side-kick, Winter Soldier and Black Falcon are all proven incapable and incompetent by one or two team guys rifles. Imagine that.

After being left the shield by Steve Rogers, I was very eager to see where Sam Wilson and Bucky Barnes' story thread would lead. Unlike something like WandaVision, The Falcon and the Winter Soldier is a much more conventional addition to the franchise. Thankfully, that wasn't a detriment. This series plays very much on the legacy that the shield has left in this universe and I thought that aspect held the show together from start to finish. There's a lot to praise about this series, but it's definitely not perfect. Here are my thoughts on The Falcon and the Winter Soldier.Picking up after the events of Avengers: Endgame and dealing with real-world issues, this series gets off to a slow start, in a good way. Giving us a new backstory for Sam and diving deeper into the mind of Bucky, we get some semblance of what really goes on in their lives, outside of the massive team films. With a new group called The Flagsmashers looming and the government appointing an unworthy man as the new Captain America, drama ensues. Between these two threats and many other characters/storylines throughout the series, I found myself glued to the screen for the majority of it. What this series suffers the most from, however, is the fact that it feels too much like a movie.Yes, I'm aware that the point of these new mini-series' from Marvel are meant to feel in continuity with the films, but this felt like a two to three-hour film that was stretched into six episodes. Yes, there is plenty going on in each episode, but some of the pacing felt slow at times in comparison to episodes like the finale. I'm not saying I need action every second, but I admit that the series felt like it took a few detours as it made its way to a conclusion. Still, most story threads come to a conclusion in the final episode and it all feels earned by the end. If for nothing else though, this duo is a blast to watch on-screen.Anthony Mackie and Sebastian Stan have always been great in these roles and their chemistry in films like Captain America: Civil War only ever elevated everything else around them. Not just their chemistry but their charisma as actors in general just radiates off the screen. Add performers like Erin Kellyman, Daniel Br\u00fchl, and Wyatt Russell, and the series just gets even better. Every single performance in this series is entirely committed and it shows. The series ends up roughly where most viewers will see it going, but it's done in a very satisfying way and I wish I had seen certain moments on the big screen. These series' are being made like movies, so it's upsetting that they can't be shown on the big screen, but that's another discussion.Overall, The Falcon and the Winter Soldier delivers on action, drama, and real-world issues being discussed on a regular basis. I loved watching this series very much, even if it felt a little slow at times. I could've easily seen this in theatres as a long film, but it also works as a series that slides right in after Avengers: Endgame. There are quite a few ideas here that I very curious to see evolve in future shows/movies. If you've followed this franchise for any period of time, I absolutely recommend checking this one out."}, {"reviewer_name": "hillnick-51908", "date": "23 April 2021", "text": "In my opinion it's not quite as good as Wandavision was.

Hard-hitting disputes regarding Racism, Immigration, Equality are being debated with utmost sincerity. Controversial? Yes to some degree yet it may well be considered the boldest representation belonging to Superhero Fraternity thus far!Earlier, I quite liked their relatively newer conceptions for 'WandaVision'. I found those to be audacious attempts to reinvigorate our beloved superhero figures! They had gone up a few notches on this occasion and created what looks to be a coalescence of Action, Drama, and Social Message altogether!A zealous undertaking that shows a different point of view upon concurrent happenings all around the globe. It may sound preachy at certain moments; therefore, some people will be in unison and others would be infuriated. However, one couldn't disavow writers' continuing efforts to raise real-world problems through celebrated comic-book heroes these days!Technically competent, this show starts right where we left off previously following the events of 'Endgame'. Falcon & Winter Soldier; both having ample opportunities to present their side of the story. By providing insights into their private lives and inner conflicts; the narrative lays down their unique characteristics more than anything else.Anthony Mackie as Falcon and Sebastian Stan as Bucky Barnes have given utter commitments to their respective roles. In the meantime making those characters their very own! The supporting cast has been pretty good as well. In particular; Wyatt Russell as John Walker, Daniel Br\u00fchl as Zemo shall be mentioned.Even with only Six episodes of 50 minutes duration each, it does become sluggish from time to time. Another big complaint lies within its inept writing on the chief antagonist 'Karli' played by Erin Kellyman. I find the emotional mainstay of this individual to be almost non-existent! As a result, we couldn't empathize with any of her reasons.Lastly, word of advice; for the avid followers of Comic-book movies, the broader topic here might seem irrelevant and forcibly conducted.

The rare exception being Christopher Nolan's Batman. However, the Captain America movies had very subtle character development and messaging which was clever and remarkably powerful. Falcon and the Winter Soldier, on the other hand, took it to the next level.It really is a series you have to commit to. You can't stop at just 2 episodes (episode 2 being the one most people stopped watching because they had a very stereotypical, unprovoked and blunt writing moment. Possibly the most cringy thing I've seen in a show in awhile.) But after that, the show goes right back to the slow burn of character arcs and storytelling.It basically starts a hero who represents the worst America has to offer and a character who is disillusioned about the country because of a common political belief among younger Americans. If people were disappointed with the ending, they clearly didn't read the comics from 1986 - 1994 like I did (aside from Werewolf Cap... it was a brilliant run.)What we see is Falcon, struggling from external pressures not step up into the roll of America's greatest hero. It's heavy cross to bare and additionally, he's encouraged to walk away because others feel the country doesn't represent people of his skin color. But those disappointed with the turn don't realize being a soldier, and representing the country isn't about race. It's about doing what's right regardless the pressure and burden. Protecting your fellow countrymen even when you disagree. Because doing what is right is rarely easy, and the sacrifice is never appreciated except by other who do the same.Anthony Mackie has been a standout actor for over a decade but hasn't gotten the praise he deserves because of hi nuanced soci-political commons over the years. But he's never been canceled, so we should be thankful. In this role, he really does put the best parts of himself in the character and the story and delivers a powerful message.America is different today than 1945 when Captain America was introduced. And we do need a new representative for American honor. Anthony Mackie is truly deserving of that character, and the story of this series is explanation of his struggles and why we should be grateful.After that US Agent is, for the most part, a representative of the beta-boy, priviliged, toxic male egotist that some stereotypically see most white people in the country to be. He's a difficult character to cheer for. But like the series on the whole, there's nuance. He certainly is the worst of what America can be, but his intentions are always good. There is satisfaction with turn. US Agent learns the error of his ways and doesn't just walk away and let others fight the battle. He does what every American has been raised to do. You made a mistake, you fall, get up, dust yourself off, and don't make that mistake again...carry on the fight.The \"Flag Smashers\" is a bit on-the-nose of the Antifa, but it's forgivable being that we never have seen a mob villain like it before. It was interesting, it was powerful and like we always say, a hero is only has strong as his villain. It did find it peculiar that Disney (of all companies) would choose to put those people in a bad light considering their affinity toward \"woke\" culture. But again, there is a turn even for them. In their (debatably) noble endeavor, they cross a line. (Now, in fairness, they basically started over the line when you consider that their crimes all had victims, just because we didn't see them doesn't mean they're not affect, but I digress.) Great villains always have a component to them that is honorable. You have to be able to see yourself in the villain and understand why they go too far. The audience should be able to recognize when things are bad in their actions. (This literally is where the term \"the moral of the story\" comes from.) So anyone who feels (and there are plenty I'm seeing) this was a sad ending and the \"bad guys won\" might want to do some introspection. The fact is, the Flag Smashers' mission was never put down or dismissed, just their actions (and some character's motives.) It's okay to support their mission, but you can't support their means.If you don't watch the whole thing and put it into context, you'll probably think it's too Ra-ra America or too Woke (weird huh?

It did not felt like a set up explanation, but more of a clean up in my opinion. But it did work well at the end. The main villain of the story, can't remember her name, did not care for her, didn't like her at the end. Erin Kellyman character was introduce as a great leader, to be seem more as a savior, even by Sam to respected and defend her, when she was actually in the mentality of a terrorist at the end. Even her followers were starting to doubt her mission. Sharon Carters transformation of Agent 13 to villain in the shadows was weird. It was set up poorly, and it was just explain through dialogue in one scene.I feel like this series would have done better as a movie, due to the pacing and this is coming from a 6 episodes limited-series.

I also have to give credit to Marvel regarding their well written inclusion of race politics and our very own perception of the society we live in. It infuses the show with a lot of relatability and makes the journey of Sam Wilson all the more poignant. His last speech, however, seemed a little too preachy moralistic to me and even made me cringe a little. It is an odd speech considering the intention of the show to leave absolute light and absolute dark behind and show us a lot of grey area.I did enjoy seeing the growing relationship between Sam and Bucky, even though I feel that Bucky got the short end of the stick when it comes to character development. It is obvious that he is not treated as an equal in that regard, which led to a lackluster and rushed final scene that was wholly disappointing. On the plus side, all the other small scenes that he had over the course of the show keep confirming me that Sebastian Stan is a fantastic actor when he gets the right material.Daniel Br\u00fchl as Zemo is top notch, but Daniel Br\u00fchl as an actor is always top notch. I am not really into all the memes that have flooded the internet, though, and I think they slightly take away from the impact he is supposed to have on the strong convictions of Sam and Bucky.Karli Morgenthau and her Flag Smashers never really grabbed me. Their motivations seem very muddled and Karli as a character remains completely flat and one-dimensional. This might not be entirely the fault of the writers or the actors, because there was supposed to be a major sub plot that had to be removed due to current events in the real world. Regardless, they don't really work in this series as a relatable foil for the downtrodden people on the planet.Sharon Carter is... not Sharon Carter anymore. They completely changed her character from the movies and while that change might be understandable from a world-building perspective, it remains to be seen whether it leads to anything worthwhile when she shows up again in future Marvel projects.The big standout of this entire show is John Walker, played brilliantly by Wyatt Russell. Instead of giving him the lazy antagonistic role to Sam Wilson that everyone expected, the writers decided to make him an extremely interesting character. Capable but flawed, good intentions but questionable executions. He surpasses all the typical super hero and super villain tropes that we are used to by now and I can't applaud Wyatt Russell enough for the way he plays that character.

Let me start by saying this series is a blast. The acting for the most part is really great, with Bucky and Sam finally feeling like special characters, the action in the movie has some of the best we've seen from the MCU, the plot is really good at giving us a perspective of what happened to the world after the \"Blip\", and the plot also helps elevate the storyline and allow the characters to naturally develop while teaching the characters and the audience a well earned important lesson.I have heard that the gripes with people watching Falcon and the Winter Soldier is that it gets bad when it gets into political themes. Let me say that not ALL movies and shows immediately become bad when it explores a political theme. This miniseries simply explains the state of civility after the Blip while the main characters struggle to stop a criminal organization that seeks to stop being forsaken by the government, learn from the villains realistic motives, and implement the knowledge to try and change the government for the better The story also explains the true meaning behind being a symbol of America.The point is, people basically just wanted this series to be a silly and dumb action flick that never bothers to explore a serious subject. And I respect the MCU for taking the series in the direction they chose to go with, and paying no mind to the petty requests of some of those who call themselves Marvel fans.Overall, I highly recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys how much care is put into a work of film, and don't listen to anyone who wrote a low review on here."}, {"reviewer_name": "waqassaleem-85201", "date": "23 April 2021", "text": "Amazing show.

Marvel is all about fiction and fantasy, if someone wanted to see a movie about racism they would've specifically searched for one. Don't let that one thing prevent you from watching the show it was still amazing and very funny at times. I didn't think the villain was that bad but the ending felt rush, unfinished.

They do so many things so well and this series really demonstrated both their ability to do things well and their ability to learn and grow. Falcon and Bucky could've easily fallen into the same trap that the Luke Cage Netflix did for me, feeling overly preachy and more interested in shoving a message down my throat than telling a story. But it doesn't. It manages to tell this really engaging story with a super prescient message interwoven in such an engaging way without making me feel like I needed to do tons of history homework to understand what people were even talking about.Marvel really has gotten this stuff down and their new forays into different series have so far been spectacular with both this and WandaVision knocking it out of the park. Strong recommend here."}, {"reviewer_name": "Redred88", "date": "3 May 2021", "text": "So, for me the main advantages of this TV show are Bucky was especially great, he did justice to own character and played it amazing and it was good see him how he accepted his past, and I enjoyed him the whole show. And I had a similar pleasant impression of devilishly intelligent and charismatic Zemo. And yet I'm pleased by the rivalry-friendly dynamics between Bucky and Sam, it was fun. I also positively appreciate that this show has a huge number of references to other Marvel films. All in all, I was interested to watch, especially when I initially did not expect much from this TV series. But there are controversial points in this show: In my opinion, in the finale of the TV series, the creators went too far with politics - very classy, a lot of big words, high morals... This may remind some people of political agitation, and therefore cause unpleasant impressions. The creators of the show here should have been more careful. But it turned out what it turned out. In addition, there was a feeling that the storyline of the show was suddenly rewritten again, perhaps that is why some of the actions and reasoning of the antagonists-supersoldiers seemed to me ineffective and illogical, which prevented me from correctly perceiving their goal and somehow empathizing with them. And it seems to me that these antagonists-supersoldiers don't look like worthy enough opponents for Bucky and Sam, either in terms of skills or potentialities. So it's strange why Bucky and Sam, who are the Avengers who fought with Thanos ' army, and are really experienced, skilled fighters, took so long to deal with them. But I'm still not too disappointed, because I got what I originally wanted - I saw the Winter Soldier, because he's one of my favorite Marvel characters, so it was just because of him that I waited and watched this show. However, this is not enough for me, I've been thinking for a long time that Bucky definitely deserves his own solo movie or TV series starring him, but unfortunately, he still doesn't have one. But the Winter Soldier has a reasons for his own solo movie: a dark, mysterious past and a complex, contradictory personality, which will allow you to create many interesting and instructive stories (brutality and showiness as in Captain America: The Winter Soldier is also welcome; what a magnificent battles there was between the Winter Soldier and original Cap Steve Rodgers. I'm still reviewing them). Especially if Marvel clearly plans to make solo film about Sam as the Captain America in the future, then it would be fair to make solo film about Bucky. But I'm worried because Bucky will probably be in those movies, but again only as the Captain America's sidekick, which means that a solo movie about the Winter Soldier is unlikely to ever be made. And I believe that Bucky can be not only the eternal sidekick of the Captain America, but also an independent character with his own personal story and various adventures. Well, hope springs eternal. And we'll have to wait and see what happens."}, {"reviewer_name": "benmundie", "date": "2 May 2021", "text": "'The Falcon and the Winter Soldier' is the second Disney+ show from Marvel Studios. Many characters reprised their roles from previous films with larger parts, Bucky Barnes (Sebastian Stan) and Sam Wilson (Anthony Mackie) both become titular characters, as oppose to supporting characters for Chris Evans' 'Steve Rogers'. We pick up with the characters in a post 'Avengers: Endgame' world; Sam has returned to the US Air Force and Bucky is just carrying on with life whilst trying to adjust to life after 'the Blip'.The chemistry between the two main characters carries every episode and leads to some great comedic moments. Making these two the star of there own show gives them some well needed development and takes their arcs to the next level. The standout performances come from Wyatt Russell and Carl Lumbly as 'John Walker' and 'Isaiah Bradley' respectively. John Walker is an exceptional secondary villain who becomes the new Captain America. One that was handpicked to take up the mantle despite not doing anything to deserve it. Whilst Isaiah Bradley is a black Captain America from the Second World War, who was imprisoned and experimented on to test the super soldier serum, just to finally be removed from all records and pronounced dead. These two are perfect mirrors of each other and display the theme of legacy that runs throughout the show.Henry Jackman (the composer) returns from the previous 'Captain America' films. His work is always exceptional but this time round he excels. He seamlessly brings scores back from previous movies, most notably 'The Winter Soldier' theme from 'Captain America: The Winter Soldier'. The effects throughout are perfect and I don't think there is an over reliance on CGI like there has been in previous Marvel pictures. I love the comic accuracy of the show, from Falcon's new suit to Madripoor, but the best example is Daniel Bruhl's 'Baron Zemo'. He returns from 'Captain America: Civil War' and is absolutely fantastic. They finally embrace him being a 'Baron' like in the comics and they elevate his motives to the next level, with his hate of the Flag Smashers.The best episodes are; 1:2 ('The Star-Spangled Man'), 1:4 ('The World is Watching') and 1:5 ('Truth').However, my main issue is the main villains 'The Flag Smashers'. The head of this terrorism group is Karli Morgenthau (Erin Kellyman) and they don't pose a threat to the protagonists in the slightest. The acting is solid from her, but the writing is quite inconsistent for the group and her motives don't really make sense. I think it would've benefited with John Walker as the main antagonist instead because his arc is undoubtedly more interesting than Morgenthau's. Also, it is really obvious that they had to scrap a subplot that was in the original script. The plot line was reportedly centred around a global pandemic and was removed as it too closely resembles the current issues in real life. This could've been a reason behind the Flag Smashers inconsistency as they play a big part in that subplot.Overall, I do think this show was an improvement on 'WandaVision' and nicely sets up future MCU titles that feature these characters. I can't wait to see where these characters go next and hope to see more of John Walker.8.5/10."}, {"reviewer_name": "georgeharold-28236", "date": "24 April 2021", "text": "This show was great people saying it was bad not true at all great all around People love saying successful films/shows are bad to seem cool and it's mostly DC fans who didn't watch and just left bad reviews."}, {"reviewer_name": "jnatsnw", "date": "24 April 2021", "text": "There are very good lessons in this show across many areas, if you can't spot them for your personal benefits then your loss.

I don't know why half these reviews are so negative when this show portrays something so important that the world we live in today should understand. It gives us a better understanding of Sam's (Anthony Mackie) story and Bucky's (Sebastian Stan) character development. The show talks about important issues that the world is struggling with today and I really liked how marvel portrayed that. You can tell that this show had a lot of love put into it with the dedicated actors and crew. Every episode had something special to it they were like mini marvel movies. I really loved the fight scene with the Dora Milaje. The action and the acting combined made this show exciting to watch every Friday and I am going to miss it because Bucky and Sam will forever be my favorite characters to watch on screen. The scene with John Walker bashing the flag smasher with the shield took my breath away. I never felt so shocked in my life (besides watching the ending of Avengers Infinity war) that scene alone showed how amazing of an actor Wyatt Russel is. In the finale, I got so emotional seeing Sam in the new Captain America suit it was a great feeling and following Sam throughout the years of marvel movies made it even more special. As for Bucky, he is my favorite character ( and Sebastian Stan is personally my favorite actor ) his character development from the beginning of the series to the final episode was amazing to see. I'm so happy he got to smile at the end and is at peace because this 100 year old man deserves everything. Also, the ending with Sharon was pretty cool to see, it's not marvel without a good cliffhanger. I also loved seeing Zemo dancing in the club. Overall, this show was amazing and deserves everything and I can't wait to see the future of MCU."}, {"reviewer_name": "hfreinoso", "date": "23 April 2021", "text": "The Falcon and The Winter Soldier was in fact, the shows I was looking forward to the most. Out of all the MCU shows they announced, such as WandaVision, Loki, Ms. Marvel, etc. None of them have my interest at all except for this show. I was not too fond of WandaVision- or heck finished the show (which took a while). Call me a hack, but that show didn't do it for me plus, with that last episode, it went downhill from that. (It set up nothing for No Way Home, Loki and Dr. Strange 2) When they said it would be like a Russo brothers Winter Soldier and Civil War type of film (My favorite), it was precisely what I got from the show. Realism a human, grounded take on the world that it is today. That's what I like about films that are human grounded, such as Spider-Man 2, Superman, The Dark Knight, Soul films that take on a realistic take of the world today. Struggles and what makes us who we are. The Falcon and The Winter Soldier was that show. I knew when they got Kari Skogland, and we saw who Sam Wilson and Bucky Barnes were, I knew I was going to dig this show. When they show who Sam Wilson and Bucky are. People don't know who Sam and Bucky are (all they know is Sam is the Falcon and Bucky is Steve's best friend); they know they are closely related to Captain America. And guess what? This show dwells deep with these characters, and it's perfect, and we finally get to see who they are.Sam Wilson, I thought, didn't deserve the shield, and Bucky did. But this show has proved me wrong. They were the whole front of the show, and it makes us love the part that SHOWS us that he was meant to be Captain America. I always knew who the powerbroker was, and I understood what Karli and the flag smashers wanted, and it is understandable instead of being a ruler or taking over the world type of person. John Walker was a mixed bag, and I liked Wyatt Russel as he did a fantastic job. However, the character was, in fact, a mix; he was NOT Captain America, but when he does at the last episode proves he can be a hero. John Walker was what the American government wanted versus what Sam Wilson was what we needed. This show tells us how the world would react if an African American were, in fact, Captain America as the character would reflect themselves on one person to another. And Isaiah Bradley the Black Captain America.I love this character, and this character was, in fact, the sad part of this show. It showed us the truth and what happened during his past and how people were like. This proving that everyone was a hero in the past, even if no one knows or even cares about it. This character got what he deserves at the end. A REAL HAPPY ending. All the show proves that the shield is all about a great human being. That is what Captain America stands for Hope and Strength to move on, and Sam Wilson could do that. A scene where Sam's nephew touches the shield. And that moment stuck with me; it's all about what it means and what it does for someone to pick up the shield and stand for Captain America. The show was great, and don't let many SJW people tell you to hate this show. And people hate that Trobe; however, unlike other films such as (Charles Angel, Black Christmas 2019... ew) this one proves to us what could happen and what others could bring out if we all had hoped on someone even if we can't believe in such things. But to me, this show wasn't perfect but was a show similar to The Winter Soldier. By far, for me, it is, in fact, better than WandaVision 10/10."}, {"reviewer_name": "moodzafar", "date": "15 July 2021", "text": "Sehingga 15 Julai 2021: Jumlah kes COVID-19 yang dilaporkan adalah 12870 kes (831,662 kes)Pecahan setiap negeri (Kumulatif): ok\nSelangor - 6,154 (272,993)\nWPKL - 3,133 (85,042)\nJohor - 336 (73,722)\nSabah - 279 (71,468)\nSarawak - 281 (67,841)\nNegeri Sembilan - 897 (50,314)\nPulau Pinang - 237 (36,054)\nKelantan - 135 (35,751)\nPerak - 543 (28,517)\nKedah - 360 (27,421)\nMelaka - 183 (20,540)\nPahang - 152 (15,387)\nTerengganu - 68 (11,589)\nWP Labuan - 64 (8,922)\nWP Putrajaya - 47 (2,495)\nPerlis - 1 (602)"}, {"reviewer_name": "Maxwell-566", "date": "26 April 2021", "text": "Can't wait for season 2 download watch and thank me later."}, {"reviewer_name": "the_wacky", "date": "26 April 2021", "text": "I love this series \ud83d\ude0d full of action n comedy between characters.

Anthony Mackie is a amazing actor and he finally gets to step up in a major bigger role in the MCU. Sebastian Stan is great and delivers a lot of emotional moments along with Mackie. Daniel Bruel returns as Baron Zemo and gives a great and awsome performance, defently a good character who I believe we are yet to see more of him in the future.

This series doesn't give answers to any of this but does hint that it's time to move forward and do better, just like Sam says in the final episode. The show does give a better view on how the U. S \"gives\" respect to it's veterans and how they prefer who's better for the image of the U. S. until finally Sam steps up and takes the mantality of Captain America. I can't wait foe Marvel to release more content similar to this show because at the end of the day, this is the kind of shows that interest people. Shows full of action that represent a good and realistic image of reality."}, {"reviewer_name": "tracy-97320", "date": "25 April 2021", "text": "It had potential & yes you can have one...max 2 cheesy speeches but they were alllll the time, no one cares that he is black captain America and making SUCH a big deal about makes it like we do have an issue when we don't, just let these shows be action and fun, it's not hard to leave the news in the news & keep these shows for our enjoyment!"}, {"reviewer_name": "goat-04054", "date": "25 April 2021", "text": "The first couple of episodes were good.

It feels like a direct continuation of Captain America: The Winter Soldier (2014), except now it's entirely Sam Wilson and Bucky Barnes' time to shine. We've seen Sam since 2014 and we've seen Bucky since 2011, but haven't been able to really learn about Sam Wilson's history besides that he had lost his wingman. This series gives us more of Sam Wilson's life story as well as an enormous amount of character development for Bucky Barnes following the events of Avengers: Endgame (2019).The Falcon & The Winter Soldier is full of outstanding writing. Important themes are woven between each scene in a masterful way and it isn't like they aren't topical subjects. It's not overdone and it's reflecting the reality of our current events in the United States in a way I'm truly shocked it has. Marvel Studios has outdone themselves again and again, but this time it's reached a new height regarding social issues our nation faces. This series shines a bright light on the hypocrisy of our government, the crimes and injustices that have occurred at the hands of those in power and the oppression that is inflicted on minorities daily. We see how Sam Wilson is uncertain about taking up the mantle of Captain America and we learn why throughout the series. Some may wonder why he doesn't just take the shield and be who Steve Rogers believes he can be? Well, there's more to it than that and showrunner Malcolm Spellman outlines why it's not so simple for a man like Sam Wilson to be Captain America.The Marvel Cinematic Universe reveals a dark history of the Captain America mantle and it directly reflects real life as experiments on people of color is no fantasy, namely Tuskegee, which the series' plot takes inspiration from. We learn about the existence of a second Captain America, the first black Captain America, Isaiah Bradley, performed by the sensational Carl Lumbly. His story is heartbreakingly gripping and I can't praise the scenes with Isaiah Bradley enough. His government used him, abused him and cast him aside to rot in a prison cell for 30 years after saving the lives of his teammates during the Korean War. This is no different than how Steve Rogers also disobeyed orders, saving the lives of hundreds of American soldiers during World War 2, and yet he was praised for his actions while just a decade later, Isaiah Bradley was thrown into prison and his history completely erased for the exact same actions. There is a clear line differentiating the life of a black man in service to his country and the life of the white man. The series doesn't blame Steve Rogers for what happened to Isaiah Bradley, the series clearly points out that the government and their unjust actions are to blame.Director Kari Skogland delivers one of my favorite television series to date. The Falcon and the Winter Soldier does not lack incredible action sequences and quiet character driven human moments that reveal the more intimate life of an everyday hero. The struggles we see them face are so real and so very relatable. Anthony Mackie portrays Sam Wilson in such a charismatic and graceful way, mirroring the qualities of Steve Rogers and it's clear to us why this man was chosen to continue the legacy of the shield. I noted that he was patient and understanding of the antagonists mindset, he isn't quick to dismiss their campaign for a better world, but explains that how they're doing it isn't right. Erin Kellyman is phenomenal as Karli Morgenthau and I loved every moment we saw of her and her fellow Flagsmashers on screen.Sebastian Stan gives a chilling performance as James \"Bucky\" Barnes. For Bucky, the series focuses on the confrontation of past sins and the importance of handling ones mental health. I can't stress how much I appreciate the writing of this series enough, because the subject of male mental health is one that has been neglected forever. Bucky is the perfect opportunity to bring this issue to attention and Stan's performance is easily one of my favorites in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. We learn about how Ayo of the Dora Milaje from Wakanda rooted out Hydra's brainwashing and manipulation from Bucky, setting him on a path of healing from his curse as the Winter Soldier. I absolutely appreciate this scene and Sebastian Stan's moving performance. Throughout the series we learn about how Bucky has continued to heal, though not without needing a necessary push here and there. His growth beyond Steve is so important and this series absolutely nails it. Bucky also comes to terms with the fact that Sam Wilson felt he couldn't take up the shield at first, that there was more than meets the eye to the situation in which Bucky and Steve couldn't have understood at first. Everything about Bucky and Sam's relationship and the writing between the two of them regarding taking up the shield is amazing. Their healthy communication and conversation is just another part of the series that deserves the utmost praise.Daniel Br\u00fchl returns for the first time since his previous appearance in Captain America: Civil War (2016). He had been sitting in prison after dismantling the Avengers from within and killing the King of Wakanda. His escape and presence is quickly ascertained by Wakanda and the Dora Milaje are not happy about it. Florence Kasumba returns leading the Dora Milaje and their performances are striking, firm and powerful especially against Sam, Bucky and Wyatt Russel's John Walker. Daniel Br\u00fchl's Zemo is given so many great character moments throughout the series and quickly elevated his villain to a GOAT'd status. I cannot wait to see him again in the future, perhaps related to an appearance by The Thunderbolts.Emily VanCamp also returns since her last appearance in Captain America: Civil War (2016). Personally I believe this character has been somewhat neglected in the universe and should've certainly been apart of more Avengers skirmishes, but that's just my opinion. I love seeing Emily VanCamp as Sharon Carter and I know that The Falcon and the Winter Soldier will not be the final time we see her. She has a lot of great character moments and an interesting explanation of where she's been since the dismantling of the Avengers. We meet her again in the city of Madripoor, a new location to the MCU that is popular with criminals, shady organizations and the like. We see that she has seemingly worked her way up in the underworld and made somewhat of a name for herself.Now, the main antagonist of this series is portrayed by Wyatt Russel. John Walker, the government's choice for the mantle of Captain America who takes on the shield just shortly after Sam Wilson was heavily encouraged to relinquish his ownership. Walker is the exact definition of an American soldier through and through. Fighting alongside Lemar Hoskins, also known as Battlestar played by Cl\u00e9 Bennett. The two of them combine to become essentially the government mandated Captain America & Bucky. They're restricted to following the rules set by the government and this causes issue with Walker later in the series because he can't get what he wants to get done without breaking a few rules and laws. This ultimately leads to the shocking events involving him, the shield, and the whole world as they watch the legacy of Captain America unnecessarily stained in blood and aggression. John Walker admits that no one understands what it takes to be Captain America, to try and live up to Steve Rogers' legacy. Now imagine how difficult it would be for Sam Wilson. That's what this series is all about.Wyatt Russel is incredible as John Walker, his character arc in the series is very on-brand compared to his comic counterpart. He's not entirely a villain but only, a hero in his own eyes and I can't wait to see more of him in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. He isn't the only character I'm excited to see more of though. Joaquin Torres played by Danny Ramirez has seemingly been set up to take on the mantle of the Falcon. I really hope we get to see him again soon in whatever possible corner of the MCU. Perhaps alongside Sam Wilson. That would be epic. Captain America, Sam Wilson is my favorite MCU character right now, no contest. This series tells an incredible story and the finale blew me away. I'm so damn happy and I really hope everyone likes his new suit and the series overall. I'm praying we get a sequel series.I adored Sam Wilson and Bucky Barnes before this, but now I love them even more. With the hope for a sequel series, tentatively named Captain America and the White Wolf or something similar, I hope we don't have to wait too long to see my guys Sam and Bucky again. Perhaps Bucky will star in his own series as a nomad... or at least, I hope so.I am beyond thankful to exist during a time when stories as wonderful as The Falcon & the Winter Soldier exist, apart of a much larger ever-growing universe."}, {"reviewer_name": "markjgriffin", "date": "23 April 2021", "text": "The rushed final episode didn't ruin it for me, but agree with most of the reviews I've read that say Episide 6 was a bit all over the place.

One episode it says there'll never be one, then the next Sam turns up in his new outfit and shield.

Zemo is back and when he showed up I totally cheered, he was an amazing villan at Civil War, but ofuscated by Capitain America and Iron Man. Here, he has much more space. Pretty diferent from WandaVision (this one is more grounded), but very great on its own way. The action scenes are very well executed, with high quality, specially at the first and the last episode. Sam as Capitain America is amazing, one of the most well made suits of MCU. The development Bucky got on this is bigger than what he had in all MCU, given us more about his time in Wakanda and how he deal with the nightmare that was his life as the Winter Soldier.Wyatt Russell is perfect as John Walker, a complex character very well executed, really convince me to hate him for life!

I've always wanted to see more of The Falcon because he's such a normal dude AND a super hero.The content in the show relating to the black community and their struggles made me think a lot. I was annoyed for a moment because there is so much tension about this subject infusing our culture now. But the more I watch and listen and really try to understand what's being said the more I can sympathize. I know sometimes it feels like \"virtue signaling\" and \"race baiting\" and any other buzz word but if there are real people out there with real issues then we need to listen. I think that The Falcon and The Winter Soldier does a fantastic job presenting these issues. They're not pushing them at the expense of the story or the characters they're infusing the conversation with emotion that fits the situations and peoples.Overall I think this is an amazing and top quality show worthy of Disney and Marvel.

While many celebrate the return of their loved ones, it does mean that some people are put at a disadvantage. Refugees from all over the world had been welcomed into countries all over the planet. They got jobs that were no longer filled. Then, once the people who had disappeared came back, they were kicked out again. An unknown number of them have now formed the group the Flagsmashers. Are they revolutionaries? Or terrorists?This mini is driven by its politics, so I'll dive into that first. The MCU continues its shift into being more diverse. I've promised myself that, if at some point, it starts getting legitimately miscalculated, if it starts feeling like pandering, or it starts to just blindly demonize its opposition, I will immediately, and honestly, call it out. No, I'm not pretending that there's no way to do this wrong. It's just that they keep doing it right.With Steve Rogers gone, countless people feel the need for someone to to take up the mantle. Some believe that it should be Karli Morgenthau(Kellyman, doing a great job walking the line between charismatic enough that she could attract supporters and lead this movement, and yet with a sense that she might go too far in the name of her goals. Yet another in a long line of \"I agree with their point, but not with their methods\" villains, and I say keep 'em coming), leader of the aforementioned group. Then again, we do already know who he chose to be his successor: Sam(Mackie, full of empathy and heroism).However, he feels that the US would never accept a black man representing it as Captain America, and hands over the shield, expecting it to be part of the exhibit in the Smithsonian. So he is of course shocked to see that, without his input, someone has been appointed to take over the title. While it's no surprise that they went with someone white, you may not have expected just how much they humanise John Walker(Russell, who has inherited all of his famous father's charm, as well as his knack for playing someone we can't stand). Suffering from imposter syndrome, and with something of a dark side, there is so much more to him than the tool that he was intended to be. In some ways, he is his predecessor's twisted mirror image: a perfect soldier, and not necessarily a good man.While colorblind casting has its strengths, I really appreciate that this instead went for colour conscious. It is very clear throughout, that there are POC both in front of, and behind the camera. It never feels like a bunch of out of touch Caucasians, working from inaccurate stereotypes, the way a lot of media did, in the past. We see where Wilson grew up, meet his sister Sarah(Oduye, a great mother, very responsible), her kids, and see what the family dynamics are like. We also get some uncomfortable and unflinching(honestly really pushing the PG-13, well, TV-14, rating) looks into how African Americans are treated in the United States, and the sadly forgotten truth of just how bad it was before more recently. Some aspects of this are barely fiction, and are clearly very heavily based on actual events.Now for the other half of the title. Let's talk about Bucky(Stan, struggling with the evils of his past). He is one of the ways that this explores how the government lets down its veterans. His court-ordered therapist can relate to him because of her own service, yet doesn't claim to be that great at her current job. She insists that he tell her all the painful details of his frequent PTSD nightmares. That he makes amends. That kind of thing is already difficult for alcoholics following the 12 steps. Imagine having murdered people for decades, and trying to break that to the victims' family members. The fact that he did it under mind control doesn't change that these people are dead, and many of them wouldn't be, if he hadn't shot them. We already knew that he remembered all of them. And have seen him be confronted with someone related to one of his victims. This is the first time we really see him intentionally go out and tell these people the truth about their loved ones.It's hard for me to put into words how relieved I am they didn't try to shove all of this into one or two movies. And that this isn't a traditional 22 episode per season TV show, where every 7 minutes or so, it has to have something dramatic happen, so that the audience will stay through the commercial break. The 6 episodes of varying length, only available on Disney+ for streaming, give the material room to breathe, instead. Honestly, there are a lot of scenes that are all about plot and character, many that are just people talking. The dialogue is so well done in both writing and performance, and go into such interesting concepts.Of course, the appeal of this series is also partially the action scenes. They are indeed on the level of huge Hollywood blockbusters, as far as scope and budget go. The trailers did not give everything away. Considering the relatively limited amount of superpowers on display, it's remarkable that it never gets repetitive. The flying, mid air battles, entering and leaving planes and helicopters in mid flight, is all amazing to behold. It's like playing Just Cause 3, which, if you haven't, and you like this kind of action, you really should. There are some new gadgets and abilities on display and they're used to great effect. The shared continuity is still a massive strength of this franchise. This sees the return of Henry Jackman, who composed for The Winter Soldier and Civil War, and he uses some leitmotifs incredibly well.I recommend this to anyone who cares about the issues that it explores, and fans of the icons. 10/10."}, {"reviewer_name": "eviemcalpine", "date": "24 April 2021", "text": "Of course, as a marvel creation, the show is amazing, with great characters, action sequences and a believable villain.

Just felt like I'd rather binge than to wait. Because Wanda vision was an issue regarding that. However this is a different caliber so I feel the story really delivers and doesn't necessarily leave anything open ended compared to Wanda vision. So watching this and taking it all in was very nice, like watching a very long movie... but with that said I'd like to address allot of these people regarding the politics... frankly I disagree with some of the political agendas the tv show is going for, but Just because a movie or show has political themes you shouldn't bash the thing, it's a different angle and you have to judge it as a movie accordingly. This show really delivers on angels without feeling cringey or forced. Look at the CW and how they handle politics and compare it to this and see what's worse... this is coming from a die hard dc fan. I love this show, it's solid, the issues I'd have with it are the main villain, story and plot just feel convoluted. However the action is probably the greatest from any tv show regarding superhero's. Very good action (daredevil I think is #1 with the action) show has issues, no denying that. But a 5/10 or lower is completely unnecessary as the show does deliver at least the basic things a show should deliver. And more. Solid marvel show, I prefer Wanda vision more but this is still solid. If anything it's a little over a 7/10 but I'll be lenient and give it a 8/10... that's ONLY if the finale blows me away. So far no episodes has really blown me away other than the one when \"captain\" does that insane gut wrenching thing at the end. But fingers crossed. If the finale is just average then I would give the show a 7/10 overall.

It is certainly the worst villain depiction I've seen so far on screen in movies and tv; her dialogue and the way she delivered it was so bad it made me laugh at times.I was confused by the villain's \"speeches\" the most. What were they trying to accomplish? If they trying to portray her as fearless and charismatic, they certainly failed. All her lines came off like I was listening to a whining high school kid.Even when they show other members of her terrorist group disagreeing with her, all she has to do is scream some slogan/motto and they shape up to execute her orders. Why?Because she is supposed to be intimidating? Or is it because they believe in their \"cause\"? I find both possible explanations to be equally laughable. One, the actress playing the villain can't act to save her life - she is less intimidating than a newborn puppy. Second, employing any sort of logic at all, the terrorist group doesn't really make a concrete argument for their actions, and their goals don't make any sense.At first I didn't think I had any issue with the political message being shoved down our throats; in fact, I think there's a part they did it well with the portrayal of the black soldier who took the super hero serum. I won't even have an issue when it's clear the political message was the only focus of the story.However, when it is obvious that other elements of the story are degraded in quality in order to politicize the show/movie, and the quality of the show/movie drops as a whole in order to accommodate that message, then yes, I absolutely do have a problem with it. As the finale came to a close, it was pretty clear that this is, in fact, what they did to the show. They sacrificed quality to accommodate a political message.On the plus side, the action is enjoyable, although it isn't good enough to watch this show for the action alone. I was also thoroughly entertained anytime Falcon, Winter Soldier, or US Agent was on screen due to their well acted out scenes.

That's all they are. And after such a long ride, I just couldn't care anymore, it had all been wrapped up in a bow, and I would have been content to leave it all with Thanos arc done. Why would I care about two minor characters? This treatment of the series made me care.Small bits of dialogue like a doctor asking how the avengers make money, discussing Sokovia, refugees and displacement, all that stuff is a reflection of our world now, that also needed to be addressed in-verse, and I think it was done well.And finally, addressing a BLACK Captain America. Whether people like it or not it needs to be addressed in this climate, and I'm sure looking through archives would clearly show how people doubted the choice of Mackie continuing the role.

Nobody had complaints of the politics involved during Captain America: Civil War which was actually about politics. Nobody cares about the first Captain America movie which was incredibly political since it involved a world war from America's perspective. What people need to understand is that discussing race is social NOT political. Discussing history of a race is social NOT political. The only people who consider it political are people who try to use their politics to stifle conversation -AKA- racists.\"Well, that's what I mean. I didn't like the actual politics involved.\"... You're talking about the follow-up storyline of two guys who were best friends with a character named Captain America. Think about that name for a second and tell me if you think the name Captain America will involve any politics. If you're actually upset about the politics of the show, you were going into this show ready to be upset. I don't think that's what people mean, I'm sure they're just upset that black people were discussed and they have a hard time confronting social issues even though they're a real part of the world and it would be a real factor in choosing a Captain America that's black. Example: Look how America reacted when the first black president was elected.AMERICAN HISTORY: Black Americans have a history of being experimented on. Isaiah Bradley's storyline is one that reflects real events that took place in U. S. history. Just because the acts are horrendous doesn't mean that the issue should be ignored.

I'm here to acknowledge the progress the MCU and Disney made in developing their characters and remind those comaplaining that the source material was HIGHLY political. Captain America started as pure propaganda. If you don't already know, look up Captain America #1 from 1941. His and the shield's story have kept up with the times as has the message. He was often at odds with his country. While it was fiction it was usually tied to reality. In the end he always fought for what was right, not what he was ordered to do or what was popular.So if you are here to blast the show, be honest.

This series is one more reason to miss Steve Roger being Captain America. In my opinion the development they gave to Bucky aka Winter Soldier was very poor. Both in the fight and development scenes it was seen that Bucky was a filler or sidekick for Sam to help him become Captain America.The Winter Soldier is one of the oldest, most iconic and highly experienced characters in combat who could have defeated everyone without Sam's help. The final episode was the only one that I found lazy or rushed, because they closed the story quickly and forcibly.

I will get to later.What I like about itIt's very action packed, screenwriter of John Wick know how to make a action movie, so don't expect another WandaVision. Acting is amazing, the plot of the entire series make sense and it's sort a realistic. Something nobody told you here, you have understand, this tv show is starting new phase of MCU, so this isn't only about Sam and Bucky, this is about future of MCU, so it's very detailed for comics book fans, the new Captain America is a shock, you will hate him, but later you will understand him, and that is the big key to next step where Marvel will go. What I know US Agent (New Captain America) will be leader of Dark Avengers, probably, so you have understand this is just a takeoff for the next phase of MCU and you have treat the TV Show like that, it kind of confirmed Thunderbolts, X-Men, Dark Avengers see what I mean? The relations between Bucky and Sam are in amazing development, in the start they don't like each other they only work together because they have to, but then they will became friends and start to understand each other, and some things that didn't make sense in the beginning will make sense in the end, like in Wanda. The attention to detail is something Marvel does very well, so that is big plus. Return of the old charecters is good, everybody thought Marvel forgot about them but no, it will connect some missing dots. The way this show is treating social problems, they don't blame anybody they just point out that these problem exist and we don't really do much about it, like I said when you are watching this you have look at the bigger picture.What I don't like\nLike other people said, it's very slow and at the same time very forced and I think it's too much for average viewer to see everything this show offers, 6 episodes is not enough, It should have been like 8-10 episodes, to build up a momentum this shows needs, like In Wanda, I don't want to compare them but I just wanted the point out one shows did this excellent and this show is not very good at it.Overall\nThis shows is great you will enjoy your time, but you need to know your Marvel otherwise you don't undestand it like you need to, and that is something the show needs to do it for you.

Please work on this Marvel, you can't depend only on hardcore fans to explain everything to regular fans."}, {"reviewer_name": "TheVictoriousV", "date": "8 May 2021", "text": "The latest products from Marvel Studios have been some of their most unintentionally illuminating. WandaVision, their first Disney+ exclusive, showed us what sort of in-text behavior the Twitter fangirls will let slide (partly because the text in question does little to decry said behavior), long as the themes and metaphors are somewhat poignant and, more importantly, the star of the show is really hot (which I can't dispute, since it's Elizabeth Olsen). The Falcon and the Winter Soldier, meanwhile, is the most relevant and revealing show they've ever made, for wholly unintended reasons.In its attempted parallels to the discourse of today, it reveals how sloppy the MCU writers' sense of continuity will get when there's lucrative commentary to be made (reminding me of HBO's Watchmen, which sacrificed its believability as a sequel for the sake of topical allegorizing and petty jabs at its own IP), while also exposing how susceptible we've all become to what the streaming sites and Instagram feeds will tell us about who's good, who's bad, and what the past looks like - including the past we're old enough to have experienced and should be familiar with. In its short run, it shows exactly what's gone wrong in the world of fandom, and the world at large.First, let's talk about continuity versus trendy social commentary. Obviously, The Falcon and the Winter Soldier explores the aftermath of \"The Blip\", that moment in Avengers: Infinity War where Thanos erased half of all life on Earth, leading to five years of largely unseen disarray. The fact that it takes place after any Avengers film is already problematic, so we'll talk more about the Blip stuff later.For one, the show implies that a black man, namely the new Captain America candidate Sam \"Falcon\" Wilson (Anthony Mackie), wearing the American colors is a touchy prospect, given the unfortunate history of the country (that is, in real life and not so much within the MCU, though they do retcon a neglected black war hero into existence), and that even a global super-celebrity like him must endure cartoonish police racism until a colleague points out who he is. It's not just that this seems ignorant of in-universe history and the existence of figures like the Iron Patriot; it's that this ignorance rubs off on the audience, effectively getting THEM to ignore OUR universe.Said fanboys will praise the show for \"finally\" giving us a piece of superhero media led by a person of color. It's bad enough to be unaware that today's comic-book cinema largely owes its existence to Blade (1998), but have they already forgotten Black Panther (2018) from this same universe? What about the fact that Wilson has financial struggles (which also doesn't seem wholly believable in the established timeline) and how this makes him more relatable than any other Marvel hero? Really, guys? I know there are too many Spider-Men to keep track of but surely we know better than to swallow this stuff uncritically?This lack of critical thinking is, in a nutshell, what's so fascinating about the response to TFATWS. Through very deliberate music choices, framing, and other shortcuts, the show makes it very clear we're supposed to ultimately admire the plight of the Flag Smashers - a globalist, AntiFa-looking bunch of supersoldiers (apparently Erskine's serum wasn't all that tricky to replicate) who wish to return to the borderless \"utopia\" of The Blip - while the new Captain America replacement John Walker (Wyatt Russell of Black Mirror), who's trying to stop them, is clearly a dick.But really, if you actually LOOK at the text, the worst thing Walker does isn't much more horrifying than the routine acts of the Flag Smashers or their leader Karli (Erin Kellyman). HER actions are meant to seem somewhat pardonable, as she's fighting against fascist government, the mistreatment of refugees, and I guess nationalism. Does that reading make sense if you actually analyze the sequence of events and what the character is objectively guilty of? Not especially, no.Still, the music and imagery insist we shall loathe entitled-white-guy John Walker and simply deem Karli to be a tragic, if misguided revolutionary, her actions rarely being framed as gruesomely as Walker's big kill. Thus, that's what the Twitter stans are rolling with, albeit disagreeing with the \"misguided\" part since not even that attribute is evident through the glorified presentation. (In other circles, this intent has clearly backfired, \u00e0 la the New Guy meme and the supposedly-piggish Don from Captain Marvel, as Walker's being hailed as a wholesome good guy.)And to be honest with you, in the show's treatment of politics and activism, it seems like the opposite has happened: that the tweenagers and Twitter stans influenced the art, not the other way around. The commentary in this show is so na\u00efve, so bereft of real answers, and so proud of this fact (The Falcon declares it might be a good thing that he doesn't understand the complexities of why politicians can't just \"open all the borders\" or \"print more money\" or whatever) that it feels like a teenager who just learned one or two buzzwords wrote it. People on the other side of the aisle might think I'm stupid for agreeing that Karli is a realistic figure, but I absolutely feel like someone like her would write The Falcon and the Winter Soldier, and then insert herself into it kinda like this.The show isn't even really saying \"AntiFa activists aren't terrorists, you guys\". It overtly rejects the label, yes, but we've already talked about why its intended message doesn't match its actual text or plot. Functionally, it's instead saying: \"Activists ARE terrorists and here's why that's good\". Whether our political youngsters have influenced the writing or Marvel is just pandering to them (by neither understanding their own world nor ours very well), TFATWS is indeed a product of the times.Was there anything I liked? Well, I do like Mackie as an actor and person, even if The Falcon was arguably done dirty here (there's a scene where he rejects black identitarianism, which I initially appreciated, but this turned out to be a part of an arc where he eventually \"knows better\"). I enjoy his banter with Sebastian Stan as The Winter Soldier, seeing the Dora Milaje was fun although their inclusion made little sense (given what we know of Wakanda), and Baron Zemo (Daniel Br\u00fchl) is still one of the better MCU antagonists, even if he's more cartoony here than in Captain America: Civil War - the groundedness of which I now admire all the more. Watch that one instead tonight, or switch to Prime for some Invincible."}, {"reviewer_name": "sweidman-28016", "date": "3 May 2021", "text": "\"I feel it. The stares, the judgment. And there's nothing I can do to change it. Yet, I'm still here. No super serum, no blond hair, or blue eyes. The only power I have is that I believe we can do better.\"Marvel's second tv series in the MCU follows Sam Wilson allying himself with Bucky Barnes to embark on a series of international adventures to thwart the activities of the Flag-Smashers, an anti-patriotism terrorist cell. Over the course of their mission, they test their abilities and patience. The Falcon and the Winter Soldier had us all hyped up following the success of WandaVision. Maybe my hopes were too high, or maybe it's just the show, but in the end I felt letdown. That's not to say I didn't like the show because I did look forward to the new episode each week. It definitely has its issues with story, but it brings the action that we all love to see with each Marvel installment. Firstly, the acting is great. Anthony Mackie and Sebastian Stan are quite fun together. They gained character development off of each other that couldn't be gained on their own. Fun jokes and disagreements are made along the way for our entertainment. We also get dramatic tension that questions both the characters and us as an audience on where we stand on the matter. It's a little strange to see Sam accepting everything at the end of Endgame and returning to a state of unwillingness, but I can understand even with the small period of time after which it takes place.When it comes to villains, this is where it becomes a little unstable. The Flag-Smashers were poorly written. Their motives were too surface level to see as an actual threat. Karli, the leader, felt very underdeveloped and could've been such a good antagonist. Part of this is because of plot taken out due to the pandemic, but still much more could've been done. John Walker is one of the more interesting antagonists in the MCU. Wyatt Russell plays him so well and good for him. Literally, I've never seen a character hated so much in the small amount of time we knew him within the first episode. His arc is good and I'm glad to see how unhinged they went.As for story, this is the root most of the problem. The story is good, but nothing special. This story isn't anything new or groundbreaking. Marvel likes to milk all they can out of each character or story from last installments, and this felt like one of the cases where ideas ran low but hyping it up made us all want more, not like we weren't going to complain about it though. Earlier I mentioned that some plot was taken out due to the pandemic, and the same happened to WandaVision. Another episode or two would've benefitted the series. The first episode took a slower approach, which I liked. But the next two episodes were still setting up which felt weird considering that was halfway through the series. The last three episodes go by fast and are better than the first half. Still, plot was missing. We were introduced to ideas that never reached a fair conclusion. The announcement of a potential second season does make sense in this case. With WandaVision there's not more to be said, but in the case of The Falcon and the Winter Soldier more could be added to reach a proper conclusion. I wouldn't mind seeing more because it's a fun show to watch. There's really good action, a fun duo centering it, and Zemo dancing in the club! In later episodes, I'm glad that Marvel took to serious topics and not ignore issues within the world today and spanning decades ago. Finally, the conclusion with Captain America is such a great choice and anyone who disagrees is wrong. The Falcon and the Winter Solider may have left me wanted I more, but I'll take what I can get."}, {"reviewer_name": "laurynl", "date": "26 April 2021", "text": "I think most of the writing is very clich\u00e9 and very predictable.

Rich with intrigue, its themes feed into each other seamlessly and through characters that are charming, likable, distinct, and interesting throughout.It's a story about race, overcoming trauma, terrorism and its roots, and the harmful effects of propaganda. These ideas work their way naturally into the Captain America canon and it never feels forced. Sam and Bucky received a lot of overdue exploration and proved themselves as tactful, well-rounded leading men capable of carrying the Captain America mantle further without Steve while maintaining his righteous legacy. Steve may be gone but I still sense his presence in these two.Despite some wonky CGI at times, the action is a fast-paced surge of blockbuster thrills that will surely please Marvel diehards. Per the Marvel norm, though, the show does bite off more than it can chew and it results in a wildly fun but ultimately rushed finale. Some questions are kept unanswered and a few new faces are left mysterious. But hey, Marvel has lived up to their promises before and they'll surely branch out on those elements in later stories and be more relevant there.The Falcon and the Winter Soldier steadies its focus on where it should: Sam and Bucky. This series shows how truly human they are despite being superheroes. I'm really satisfied I sat through this show.

Out of the few times MCU works have disappointed me, The Falcon and Winter Soldier is by far the biggest disappoint so far. I was excited to see these characters grow, I feel like we hardly got a chance to focus on the character of Falcon, and Winter Soldier is just such an interesting character that I was excited to see what they did with him. Instead what we got was an incredibly dull and preachy drama with no purpose whatsoever except to fill in the gaps of future projects. I feel like this show's message is incredibly contradictory, focusing on hate and aggression, while also providing social commentary on the possibility of a black captain america. Instead of truly touching on these topics, I feel like it's just the start of a conversation they didn't know how to finish, and instead of finding that middle ground, they just jump to the conclusion and expect us to be fine with it. This show is incredibly frustrating to watch, and there is almost nothing special about it. The color scheme is a broad grey all the way throughout, and the story is so incredibly slow paced- you will easily lose interest. The new captain america suit also is a mess, with so much going on at once it's honestly just hard to look at. The actors try their best, but some can just be a little too much to handle at times, and no matter how hard they try, it's not enough to overtake the blank narrative this show is stretching along.

Instead he goes to the small town bank that knows how broke his family is.The good, it's amazing how many other people are in in this besides the star and a good balance for all, the actor for US Agent, perfect, though why Battlestar had to die instead of just be severely injured, especially since he seemed to take the same punishment that Falcon had repeatedly and he later became Captain America.Sharon Carter, nice to see her get some work, the Baron Zemo story was pretty good, kind of like an 'anti-batman', even though he's a bad guy, I assume he was in Black Panther, which I refuse to watch, mainly since I hated the character in the comics throughout it's incarnations over the years, just bad writing, period.The action is almost as good as the two Captain America movies, nice to not have overwhelming CGI everywhere.Batroc is a scene stealer."}, {"reviewer_name": "grobual", "date": "4 May 2021", "text": "So, I have watched half of the episodes and I am wondering where all the major issues are happening. Action, check. Humour, check. Political? Well, yeah. Any series that dealing with a government, or ruling party, is by nature, political. How about being overly 'woke'? Well, the social concious is constantly evolving, changing. The idea of wokedness is overused and irrelevant. How about 'BLM'? Well, in the comics, there was a storyline where Sam Wilson becomes Capt. America, which happens decades ago. The Marvel Universe didn't end at Avengers: Endgame, it continues on. The Falcon and the Winter Soldier, as other movies and series, like 'WandaVision', sets the groundwork for new movies and series. But, my review of the series? It's solid, but slightly preachy. Not as action packed, or as full of humour as earlier offerings, but it isn't supposed to be. It deals with politics, espionage, and intrigue. It deals with organizations, dark and known, trying to gain the upper hand in global affairs, not magical beings, aliens, or mutants. It should be watched for what it is, and not as we think it should be."}, {"reviewer_name": "phillipjohnhopkins-76745", "date": "1 May 2021", "text": "This latest Marvel outing has had a lot of negative reviews and while I tend to agree with some of the comments, I was glad to see that it veered away from becoming an extended Marvel movie. It does get slow at times but I guess the intention was to weave more humanity into the tale rather than a good ole punch-up every episode.I found episode #5 rather tedious, however, the previous four and the finale are paced just right and with enough traditional action to keep everyone happy.The premise of the story pits activists perceived as terrorists against the establishment \"good guys\", who, as it turns out, are many shades of grey within themselves, with personal battles going on alongside the action. The stage is definitely set for another series which looks as though it could go down a more recognised route to super hero adventure.Don't let negative reviews put you off watching. Give it a chance and decide for yourself whether or not to stick with it."}, {"reviewer_name": "ty-jensen", "date": "23 April 2021", "text": "I'm a huge Marvel fan so I was really excited for Falcon and Winter Soldier in fact it was my most anticipated MCU Disney+ show. Falcon and Winter Soldier is great, it's a fun spy thriller.When I talked about the first episode, I hastily claimed Falcon and Winter Soldier is lighthearted. It's actually gritty like the Captain America sequels. Yeah, there's some humor mainly in the first half.Falcon and Winter Soldier fleshes out the characters like any good show should. We learn more about Sam mainly his family. Bucky is tormented by his past and he's trying to make up for his sins. Zemo returns from Captain America: Civil War and he's fleshed out more. The villain isn't another generic villain but I personally find her bland.Falcon and Winter Soldier is leisurely paced, it's fast sometimes. Episode 1 and Episode 5 are slow so some fans feel they're too slow. This show is really political so some fans are upset. The showrunner and most of the writers are black so it has a strong anti-racist message.The action scenes are great in fact this show begins with a huge action scene. Yes, it's really intense like any spy thriller. Episode 5 lacks action which is fine. Yes, the visuals are great mainly the cinematography.Overall, Falcon and Winter Soldier is a fun spy thriller. It's standard MCU but it's not another simple action show. I'm not a parent but I don't think young kids will enjoy it.

There are a handful of great action scenes, the narrative works in some topical elements and works in a grey area where they expect the viewer to ask which side is really in the just? It kind of falls apart late into the final episode though, where the writers either assume they didn't get their themes through well enough (or that the audience wouldn't understand them) and have they key character blatantly preach the themes they were trying to get at.Sam's Captain America look is really cool though, so I'm interested in seeing where he pops up next."}, {"reviewer_name": "BatBanks", "date": "4 May 2021", "text": "The story takes place after The Avengers: Endgame, where Sam and Bucky are struggle with their lives.

The action/fighting scene between first episode, Sharon (Emily Van Camp) & Dora fights with the guys and the end.3. Zemo steals in episodes 3-4.And now finally the cons:1. The series too focused on racial issues. We all known Sam is black and has problem in life, but please focused on the story. This is because the mini-series is written by a black guy.2. Don't expect to be a \"buddy movie\" like Lethal Weapon, etc., it not. It more of a superhero drama.3. The last two episodes were weak and dull and should've be better.The series is mediocre at best, it would've been better without the racial stuff.

Using a \"everything but the kitchen sink\" methodology Falcon and the Winter Soldier mixes up a bundle of prominent Cap storylines with some solid characterwork.Everyone does well here, particularly the charismatic leads but Wyatt Russell shines more than most as the more morally complex Cap. There are some strikingly dark beats here as well - which only make the occasional clunky action-film-trope plot tangles and tangents all the more frustrating.

It is not the most subtle of shows, true, but come on, it is a MCU tv show not some Russian art movie ...\nFor me the show strengh has been the acting, the chemistry among the actors, the banter and the core idea. And I just loved Sebastian Stan, got to admit it.To me, the core idea of the show is about power - who has it really, how it can belong to one person or to a system, how it can corupt but not necesarily. And for an MCU show I think it does a good job at actually having a point.The show weakness was the villan... because we are supposed to believe that the person being the main villan managed to build this huge system but nothing in the story actually shows us that this is true ... it's a lot of tell instead of show, which is the opposite of good writing ... and the actress playing the villain is not all that convincing...\nBut I liked the set up for season 2 ... looks like a much better bad girl will take the main stage ..."}, {"reviewer_name": "andersson-henry", "date": "2 May 2021", "text": "Most things in this show are good, the two main characters along with John Walker and Zemo really steal the show.I think the goals of the Flagsmashers are quite understandable, since the GRC are trying to.send away the people who helped keep the countries afloat during the blip. However, this isn't explained too well so the average viewer won't understand what's going on. Mostly, the flag smashers come across as a gang with their gang leader Karli and her closest henchmen. Another problem with the flagsmashers is that they are way too powerful in fights. They're fighting one of the best soldiers John Walker and one of the best assassins The Winter Soldier, even Sam with his avengers experience and Falcon suit. And they're always fighting them with no problems whatsoever, even winning at times. I don't think this makes much sense.Another bad part of the show was Sharon. / Power Broker. During the time we haven't seen her since Civil War, she has apparently become one of the largest criminals in the world, with insane amounts of connections and power. She is shapeshifting in the final episode. And at the end she gets pardoned and continues with her criminal ways.

Also i'm french so sorry for the mistake, no auto correct so my english level is at plain sight.Secondly i rewatch the first episode after have just seen endgame and finished the serie. I just realised the second view was my best and i'm planning maybe to continue or just watch the last episode to have, in a MCU running perspevtive, a direct jump from Endgame without all the expending stuff ( new phase 4 villain, return of Zemo ect...) to the last episode witch is Falcon is the new capMy review's title is a response of a lot of \" too political \" stuff i saw on other critics, so it biased a little bit my thoughs and i want to defend in a way this series, i woul't put an excellent rating otherwise.Before that i want just to Mention how awesome Kevin Feige and his producers gang have managed to perfectly time our best entairtainment. They just have time to finnish the previsous Phase with SpiderMan FFH. ALso they planned TV show, just before everyone on the planet would be cramped in home, with theater ( right now in france, in the 1 th may, still closed ) so they would have a huge audience and the MCU still running. Also The BLIP is awesomely close to what we are living. To finish that, the last Episode 6 of The falcon was pretty much released the same time an historical judging occured by sentence the Police who killed Goerge Floyd ( i will come back to that later ). Of course all of that wasn't attended... that's why my only Theory is than Keving Feige used the time stone to sneak peak our actual present.Jokes aside.I Found the serie brillant yet predictable, i quickly though that The falcon whould be the new cap and to be perfect i would have to be wrong and the actual hated new cap evolve more that just being a step for Sam, They found a gold New Cap ( Aka future US Agent ) , i mean he was just irritating, ( also mention the IRL actor death treats he received ) playing like that with the audience was good and i managed to be attracted to his anti heroism too. Not so much for Zemo or agent carter for now.The places are nice, i loved the cyberpunk new place and also the European tour is good to the eye in this lockdown times ( new travelling ideas... ) after Spiderman initiated it recently. It offer more richness.The main vilain is what Sam says , a fuming teenager. I like the way they also take inspiration about yellow vest movment and other major group without a particular political leader but just the need to destroy the very established order for a better comunaurarism. It's of course an hommage to older litterature who treat of that.This series after WondaVision is more common but also more earth grounded. Less spectacular but complementary. I found respectable they did only 6 episodes. I think it miss one between the 5 and 6 because the case from Wakanda with the Falcon Cap Suit gift for me is a bit rushed. Maybe it have to do with Chawdick boseman actor loss so a diminished Wakanda scenes.The arrival of Sam as a new Cap is not enough spectacular in the first scene but i liked the way the director made a mirror of the first \u00e9pisode, a white costume with a black heroe in the night where the beginning is a black heroes on a black suit in a desert in plain daylight. It came from Ironman ish with the hummer and rockets and army to a more Cap city based action pack.Also in negative point few action moment where the balance of humour and seriousness don't worked ( like the lab explosion and how Zemo, Bucky Sam and Agent carter managed to survived ) and few thing rushed and maybe Bucky was somehow a bit strange in his character lines/developpement. Kinda an absence and maybe he wasn't meaned to be so much on screen intialy.We arrive of the Scene with the cops with Sam as a Cap and the Speech.I listened twice because the first one the Goerge Floyd Judgement resonate too much to me that i only see the Black and White stuff here and miss all the deep layer of the writing. After seeing another time, i just found the Sam we knew in Winter soldier, the veteran \"shrink' listener to help people go better. As Steve did also in beginning Endgame in Absence of His pal Sam, to continu in a way his unharmed legacy. I found that brillant that Sam Step up of being better him and not a new Steve Rodgers.After seeing The Falcon and the Winter solider , i just found the Sam we knew in Winter soldier, the veteran \"shrink' listener to help people go better. As Steve did also in beginning Endgame in the Therapy Scene in Absence of His pal, Sam, it's a tribute in a way of his unharmed legacy. Sam in Winter Solider is first seen as a \" listener \" to help people to recovery by making Therapy meeting, he is the retired who Steve meet to ask some help... in endgame, when sam vanished Steve is found listenning to people, he never say it but it's kinda a tribute to what sam does before he vanished, he was no longer there so Steve continue his legacy. The Falcon and Winter soldier in a way made that past friendship even more beautiful because everything make sense now, that's brillant inter-show writing.Also the closing chapter of the redemtpion of Bucky have the guts to say the truth and for Isaiah Bradley being at the museum and being celebrated and hug with sam give me a tear, because of all the suffers this two character somehow connected been through they are finally moving forward and the symbolism way the slavery people have a statue of themselves to be recognize as they contributed even against their will for the country.

The difficulty here is they are trying to push supporting actors into the fore during a lockdown, and in this short format they've chosen not to give each enough detail before the end of each episode. Before Phase 3 Marvel - a very simplified title - used to be really good at multiple delivery paths that all connected up; they didn't need to bog the films down with too much detail because they had side projects that filled you in. One Shots and shows like Agents of Shield or Agent Carter connected to the films. They might not have been great for everyone, but they supplied a more developed look at the Universe Marvel have created, and worked the time slot format allotted.Here, we have Sam Wilson dealing with his future, his family, his life. Bucky Barnes trying to shake off his past, his future and his life, all against the massive politics of a post Endgame world that seems far to political for a franchise that's more used to smashing aliens in the face and blowing stuff up, alongside shoehorning in real world issues that the writers probably read in the morning paper.Mackie, Stan and particularly Br\u00fchl do great work with what they're given, and Carl Lumbly is as captivating as always, yet the fact it only got one acting nod for the Emmy's - and even MCU stalwart Don Cheadle doesn't know why he got that - is more testament to the poor writing than the talent. It's an angry time and everyone is angry, but with so many threads, it's just not enjoyable. Erin Kellyman as Karli Morgenthau had all the backstory and knowledge to make a great villain, but they wasted that potential by saddling the story with so much extra political wrangling that she became another lost kid. While Wyatt Russell as John Walker manages to create the MCU's most hated character after barely any screen time! And bringing Emily VanCamp back as Sharon \"Like he said! Captain's orders!\" Carter, is a good nod to the Winter Soldier film, but it is so obvious what they're doing with her character they might as well include it in the credits.Ultimately, people will watch this as a tee up for Phase 4.

The reason for my decent scoring was the cinematography which blew me away, the amazing work of camera angles and high quality production was not what i was expecting from a marvel TV show."}, {"reviewer_name": "Darkjak007", "date": "22 May 2021", "text": "Coming off of WandaVision Anthony Mackie and Sebastian Stan reprise their roles as The falcon and the Winter Soldier. Sam stops a group of terrorists led by Batroc the leaper(George St-Pierre) We're followed by a ceremony commemorating Steve Roger and what he represented. Sam speaking with roadie(Don Cheadle) on how he doesn't feel he can take up the mantle. He chooses to leave the shield at the captain America museum. Bucky on the other hand still suffering from trauma as his time as the winter soldier seeing a therapist. Things take a drastic turn for the matter when all of a sudden the government has selected a new man to be captain America name John Walker(Wyatt Russell)and a terrorist organization known as the flag smasher ran by a girl named Karli Morgenthau(Erin Kellyman) want to try to return the world State to how it was during the snap. Sam& bucky of the highlights of the show. They both offer up on your amount of screen time . While does tend to put it focus on Sam see how he returns to his live and how he can't decide what does he want to do or if he should do anything. Bulky on the other hand he he has a lot of conflict and resentment towards Sam for his decision to give up the shield. He starts questioning Steve choice if Steve was probably wrong about Sam it was probably wrong about him as well?. Baron Zemo(Daniel Bruno) outside of a silly dance number shows more of his comic counterpart, he still has the wit and intellect but also a charismatic charm of a man who has the situation at hand. He's not really an expert combatant and a master of the sword unfortunately but he really makes up for that with his charm it makes you wish that he was the villain of this whole series but instead he's more have a i'm a tagalong. Karli this is who Zemo should have took her place this villain is not compelling, her motive is lackluster contrived she's a brat and a Fanatic who doesn't really have any Hook of what she's doing for a convoluted idea of unity and political oppression it's like they try to do another kill-monger except for no Depth whatsoever. Lastly there's John Walker as the new captain America which is really not much to say about him he's more or less what you would expect for the guy as the as the story progresses really out right now the direction it's going to go with him. Though it is an interesting concept to Drive Sam into the mantle. Most part of the show keeps a steady pace and flow for a limited run a really where it starts to lose attention overall is with the flag smashers I really don't get why didn't go with Zemo as the villain here. You could've done some sort of message with him if that's what they really want it, but we're just giving these one offs characters who you don't really care about and honestly are just gonna forget about them after the shows over. They're not gonna leave that much of an impact and it's almost as if they purposely falsely marketed it to make it seem like Zemo was going to be the threat of this show. While the show does have a bit of a political lecture to it, it doesn't suffer entirely from it. It does keep you invest with Sam&Bucky, action scenes though it's still suffers which it's villain and the story."}, {"reviewer_name": "deepfrieddodo", "date": "4 May 2021", "text": "A really inconsistent series, in that the first three episodes drag, the fourth picks up and the final two are great, leading to a brilliant finale. But the ending doesn't make up for the beginning. Overall it's a good show but nothing special, neither of the leads are strong enough characters to be standalone in the early stages and they ruined a perfect villain in Zemo. The different take on the enemy group is a nice twist and led by a fresh lead villain which is appreciated, as is the new Cap figure, but nothing flows or gets you gripped at any point for the first half of the series. Plus Carter is an unwelcome and disappointing return. It could have been a whole lot better.People complaining about it being 'woke' are ridiculous, and it's barely political to call out a society's former and continued discrimination. This doesn't really enter the story until the latter episodes and all it does is add substance and context to some of the most important characters. Superhero stories are about good and evil, therefore morality within government structure is of course a valid route to go down. It's got to have some political leaning and it does this without aggressively pushing any movement other than combatting ignorance. Evidently fictional discrimination is perfect for some audiences but bringing real life into a universe increasingly becoming more in line with modern day contexts is too far."}, {"reviewer_name": "Entertainmentsparadise", "date": "3 May 2021", "text": "Falcon and Winter Solider does an adequate job at incorporating various characters within the scope of the overall plot. Although the beginning of this backloaded mini series did not catch my attention; ( I attribute that to it seeming like they just through action in my face).

Bootleg Cap:\nMy dislike for the 'next' Captain America, made other characters seem more interesting.2. He's not ' The Black Flacon' he is THE Flacon\nDid Marvel effectively display race and ethical issues while steering it into a positive direction? All while giving hope to not only the black community but to those who believe in the peace that comes along with the persona of Captain America.Yes they did, Anthony Mackie shines in this mini series. Not only does it seem like he is the main attraction, his character gained the opportunity to display more of his personality within the Marvel Cinematic Universe.Winter Solider shows some character growth and they used his character in a supporting.Verdict: Falcon and Winter Solider didn't wow me.

The trailers hardly impressed me and the two protagonists never showed themselves to be a good duo. Your screen time together can be reduced to the few scenes from Civil War.After the first 2 episodes I wasn't convinced either. Falcon with his backstory & morals didn't itch at first and Bucky, who was my favorite of the two, seemed very grumpy and annoying to me.After Daniel Br\u00fchl's comeback as Baron Zemo, the series took a better & more entertaining direction with this three constellation.General always had one action scene from the series burned into my brain per episode. One of the Falcons helicopter chases, the truck fight and the shootout at the docks.I didn't care about the new Captain America and his partner until the end of episode 4. After that, the whole thing took a completely different turn.And I don't wanna forget the antagonists, who, strictly speaking, cannot be called antagonists, got a clever and understandable reason for their actions.I don't want to say anything more about the last 2 episodes, because they changed the average series for me into a real surprise hit from the MCU.Definitely consistent and runs better from episode to episode than Wanda Vision, which quietly couldn't pick me up again after episode 3."}, {"reviewer_name": "nadgetsun", "date": "2 May 2021", "text": "As much as i love the falcon and the winter soldier as characters and appreciate the political topic this show intended to bring to the audience's attention, it did not tell a good story with its broken character arcs and less than intriguing plot.

I think it is admirable for Marvel to do this especially when they are bringing the the forefront the first American black super hero. That is going to come with a lot of baggage in this day and age, and I for one enjoyed the hell out of it.'WandaVision' was the first MCU streaming show to drop and it was interesting and different and generated a decent amount of buzz mainly due to being the first real Marvel MCU content since 'Spider-Man: Far From Home'. All the talk mainly swirled around the mystery of the show and further what it might portent for the future of the MCU as we know Wanda will figure significantly into the next Doctor Strange film. The show, while quite good, did not do as much, from a larger MCU point of view, as we thought it might which was a disappointment to some. We were reminded that MCU mastermind Kevin Feige did not want the shows to be required viewing for the MCU as a whole, or so they claimed at the time. And here comes 'Falcon & the Winter Soldier' kind of blowing that concept out of the water. There are some seismic shifts that occur that will greatly effect the films going forward. Who knew? After 'WandaVision' I thought this was going to be a, more or less, throwaway, action oriented series with a bit of an insular story. Instead this series was so much better than that and does so incredibly much in a scant six episodes. This series really delivers. It made me love Sam Wilson that much more and Bucky that much more as well. It took both from peripheral characters and launched them into the limelight, and when all is said and done it gave us an honest to goodness new Captain America, and not just a cheap replacement for Steve Rogers, but instead a well earned, well deserved heir to a title both vaunted and complex.This is a great pairing for a TV show. Bucky and Sam are both connected to Steve Rogers and are both having to deal with not only their own issues but the legacy left them by a now off the radar Captain America who functioned as coworker, friend, mentor and ideal. Sam is still working in some capacity for the U. S. government although I don't think he is legitimately beholden to any branch at the show's outset. We see him have a cool fight with some terrorists including Georges Batroc, played by Georges St. Pierre, who first appeared in 'Captain America: The Winter Soldier'. Sam is also still in possession of Steve Rogers' shield. With no desire to become Captain America he turns it over to the government with the understanding that it will be on display. They instead quickly name a knock off Cap in the form of Wyatt Russell, who is about equal parts good and evil through this story, but definitely not destined to be Captain America for a multitude of reasons.Bucky is still struggling mentally with all his actions as the Winter Soldier and he is in therapy and working to make amends for all the wrong he did. Sam giving up the shield gives Bucky the excuse to confront Sam. At this same time a group of terrorists known as the Flag Smashers arise and seem to include numerous super-powered humans which immediately leads to the idea that there is additional super soldier serum out there. We get reappearances of Sharon Carter in a new and improved role and we also get the return of Baron Zemo who seems on the verge of becoming a Loki level antihero. We learn of Isaiah Bradley who was an African American super soldier during the Korean War who has been wiped from the history books. The action bounces around the globe, but many Marvel fans will delight at the first appearance of Madripoor in the MCU.The only thing I thought a bit confusing was the core of the Flag Smashers cause. They are basically fighting for international refugees who have been displaced due to so many people returning from the Blip, which is what the MCU references as the five year disappearance and reappearance of people from the events of 'Infinity War' and 'Endgame'. They want things to go back to the way they were before the Blip and are using violent means to accomplish it, but they don't really seem to have a plan other than we are upset and going to show it. They, and more specifically their leader, become the primary antagonists of the film, and with super soldier serum it provide plenty of kick ass fight scenes.The amount of ground covered in 6 episodes is really amazing. The most important plot thread is the process by which Sam Wilson goes from Falcon to Captain America by the end of this show which is vital in this era of amplifying minority representation. The legacy of Steve Rogers casts a shadow, but the legacy of African American superheroes does as well. The addition of Isaiah Bradley and his story adds so much more depth and resonance to Sam's journey and decision making process. As part of this is the U. S. government's attempt to shoe horn John Walker into the role of Captain America who is complex in his own right and will have a role in this world going forward. Bucky has a wonderful character arc in this story with his history as the Winter Soldier. If you take the Flag Smashers as stand ins for international refugees that story becomes really compelling in this modern era of more stringent borders and displaced persons. Zemo has a compelling return to prominence from obscurity as well as Sharon hiding out in Madripoor.From start to finish this show is thrilling from the action to the nuanced storytelling to evocative imagery. I don't think anyone will ever forget the image of John Walker standing above a man he just murdered with the bloodstained Captain America shield. Even in the message laden story the entire project still feels very Marvel. The show still had a lot of that trademark Marvel humor without pushing it into silly or dopey territory. The plot and storylines never felt overly burdensome or encumbered by touching on issues of race or refugees or any other topic. It was handled brilliantly and comes to a rousing conclusion that leaves you thirsting for more, and wondering where it will all go from here, and that is not only the mark of a good television show but a specialty of Feige and the MCU brand.Eric's Grade: A-"}, {"reviewer_name": "angelajm", "date": "30 April 2021", "text": "Loved the politics, loved the wokeness, lots of fun and exciting.

I think when we get some distance from current events people will realize how great a job they did on this show of not leaning too far either way. One of the strengths of MCU characters is how real the people behind the mask feel...and Disney delivers a really fleshed out backstory for Sam. It's more emotionally more akin to Captain America: Civil War than Captain America: The First Avenger.

I really liked seeing the character development of both Sam and Bucky as individuals, and as friends. The show starts out with the struggles they face following the events of \"Avengers: Endgame,\" and into new struggles. While it still includes their hilarious rivalry from the films, it slowly shows them realizing that they have more in common than they realize, and they find a newfound respect for one another.I also liked that the show brought back a few forgotten characters from \"Captain America: Civil War;\" Helmut Zemo and Sharon Carter, and it was very interesting to see their character arcs as well. From showing a more funny and human side to the dark, disgruntled Zemo, to a more streetwise and embittered Sharon Carter, I was really intrigued to see how their characters had been faring since we last saw them in the franchise. Likewise, I thought it was great that the show addressed current issues in our world today, especially systemic racism through the character of Isaiah Bradley- a forgotten super-soldier, whose tragic story was erased from history.On the other hand, while I liked the way the show ended, I was disappointed that they never fully explained what happened to Steve Rogers, especially since he and Bucky never got the best closure that I was hoping for in \"Endgame.\" Likewise, I wish they could have given Sharon Carter more redeeming qualities than they did at the show's end.

This time, instead of focusing on two of the universe's most powerful beings, we followed the adventures of Sam Wilson and Bucky Barnes, two mostly underdeveloped side-characters from the Captain America franchise. This pairing provided a type of show that could not be any more different from WandaVision, one that is more grounded and that allows less space for speculation.The first couple of episodes of the show were good, but did not instantly command my attention. They established a whole bunch of plotlines : Sam trying to save the family boat, Bucky making amends, John Walker being the \"new Captain America\", the Flag-Smashers wreaking havoc, and many more. All were interesting to some extent, but I doubted even then that the show would be able to capitalize on all of them. It seemed very ambitious, perhaps too much.Episode 3 was the one that truly made me jump on board for the first time. Getting to spend more time with Sharon Carter and Baron Zemo was incredibly exciting, and the sighting of Ayo from the Dora Milaje made me excited for the following week, which did not disappoint. \"The Whole World Is Watching\" was this show's \"Previously On\", a storytelling masterclass that blended action, humour, high stakes and a final shot that lingered long after the credits rolled. It was easily the show's finest moment.But then, my fears became real : the last pair of episodes could not manage to resolve everything in an orderly manner, because it was just too much. They nailed the payoff of some plotlines, but failed to capitalize on others. For instance, Isaiah Bradley and Zemo's respective arcs were handled very well, but John Walker's felt rushed. I think that the show would have benefited from at least one more episode, perhaps even two : it would have allowed every story element more room to breathe, and the pieces would have fallen into place more neatly.However, do not take my criticisms too heavily : I still think that The Falcon and the Winter Soldier was an incredibly entertaining series with a positive and timely message at its core. I loved the score by Henry Jackman, the performances from the entire cast and the spectacular action scenes, which often made me wish I had a bigger TV. Had it cut down on the overabundance of storylines, this would have been on par with WandaVision, but it is still another great Disney+ show as is.
