He does literally nothing in three different parts of the planet. Why does Ilene Andrews call after Jia when she runs off? She's DEAF! Why is Maya Simmons in this movie? She's the disposable daughter of the mad genius who displays no talent at all and dies off camera.Let's ignore the sheer human deaths in the thousands in every major act. Yet in every film to date, these awful parents allow their children to interact with titans. Usually when it's raining. Let's forget that children are able to walk inside not one, not two, but three highly sophisticated and guarded locations without interference. Plus they hitch a ride into some kind of mag-lev container which is transporting eggs we never hear about again and has a display in MPH even though it's an Hong Kong craft. The only thing this film does better than Godzilla: King of the monsters is there's fewer scenes with rain. But there's still a ton of rain. Why? I don't know.Why did they need Kong to \"lead\" them into hollow earth. They already had a reinforced cave leading to it. Kong didn't do anything except fall through a wormhole unscathed. While the humans needed three anti-gravity spaceships to travel there. And of course the debunked defamed author Nathan Lind is somehow also a pilot who once safely back home decides to stay airborne to watch the Titans battle it out instead of getting far away like a sane person might do. And this magical author/pilot found the single switch on the control panel which turns it into an ape defibrillator. And sure, chain up a titan on a transport boat but let's rig up a single lever to let him go. Hey, here's an idea, let's upload the essence of a dead hydra skull brain into a robot's energy source.Let's talk about how every light source in the facilities, crafts and bases plus all the buildings are lit in neon trim like they looted the set of TRON:legacy. How come Apex needed this mysterious energy source from Hollow Earth and when they take a small sample, they only thing they needed was math to recreate it? Did you know all you need to interrupt a satellite uplink into an unguarded control room is a half flask of booze poured on the cooling fan? I didn't, but the randomly Australian comic relief did.There's hardly a hint of blood from either monster even though Godzilla rakes its claws deep into Kong's flesh multiple times and both are dragged face-first into glass and steel buildings. Kong is also a master axe-man who uses the blade as a tool, a key and a shield.I could go on and on about this film but I am exhausted.

Kong is visited by Jia, the last Iwi native and Kong expert Ilene Andrews' adopted daughter, who is deaf and communicates with Kong via sign language.Bernie Hayes, an employee of Apex Cybernetics and host of a Titan conspiracy theory podcast, extracts data suggesting sinister activities at a Pensacola facility. However, Godzilla suddenly attacks the facility; during the rampage, Bernie stumbles on a massive device. Madison Russell, a fan of Bernie's podcast, enlists her friend Josh to investigate Godzilla's attacks. Apex CEO Walter Simmons recruits Nathan Lind, a Hollow Earth theorist, to guide a search for a power source into the Hollow Earth, the homeworld of the Titans. Nathan is initially hesitant as his brother died on an expedition to Hollow Earth due to a strong reverse-gravitational effect. He agrees after Walter reveals that Apex has developed HEAVs, specialized crafts able to withstand the pressure exerted by the gravity field.Nathan meets with Ilene and convinces her to let Kong guide them through the Hollow Earth via an outpost in Antarctica. Nathan, Ilene, and an Apex team led by Walter's daughter Maia board a modified barge escorted by the U. S. Navy that carries a sedated and restrained Kong. Godzilla attacks the convoy and defeats Kong, but retreats after the ships disable their power and trick him into thinking they are destroyed. To avoid alerting Godzilla, Kong is airlifted to the Hollow Earth entrance, and Jia convinces him to enter the tunnel while the team follows him in the HEAVs.Madison and Josh find Bernie, who joins their investigation. They sneak into the wrecked Apex base, discover a secret facility underground, and are inadvertently locked into an underground monorail transport to an Apex facility in Hong Kong, where they unwittingly stumble on a test of Mechagodzilla. It is telepathically controlled by Ren Serizawa, the son of the late Ishiro Serizawa, through the neural networks from a severed head of Ghidorah, but is hobbled by its power supply's limitations. Walter intends to harness the Hollow Earth's energy to overcome Mechagodzilla's limitations.Inside the Hollow Earth, Kong and the team find an ecosystem similar to Skull Island. They discover his species' ancestral throne room, where they find remains of an ancient war with Godzilla's kind and a glowing axe made from another Godzilla's dorsal plates. As they find the power source, the Apex team sends its signature back to their Hong Kong base despite Ilene's protests. Attracted by Mechagodzilla's activation, Godzilla arrives in Hong Kong, and sensing Kong, he directly drills a shaft to the throne room with his atomic breath. In the ensuing mayhem, Maia and the Apex team attempt to escape but their HEAV is crushed by Kong. Kong, Ilene, Jia, and Nathan ascend to Hong Kong, where Godzilla and Kong battle. Godzilla is initially overpowered by Kong, but Godzilla emerges victorious while Kong loses consciousness.Madison, Josh, and Bernie are caught by security and taken to Walter. Despite Ren's concerns over the power source's volatility, Walter orders him to activate Mechagodzilla. They lose control of Mechagodzilla, who kills Walter and electrocutes Ren, and then attacks Hong Kong. Godzilla and Mechagodzilla battle, but Godzilla is overwhelmed. Nathan revives Kong by destroying the HEAV, and Jia convinces him to help Godzilla. As Mechagodzilla overpowers both Titans, Josh short-circuits Mechagodzilla's controls with Bernie's flask of liquor, momentarily interrupting the mech. Godzilla supercharges Kong's axe with his atomic breath, allowing Kong to destroy Mechagodzilla. Madison, Bernie, and Josh reunite with Mark Russell, while Godzilla and Kong acknowledge each other before the two go their separate ways.

Starring Millie Bobby Brown, Julian Dennison, and Alexander Skarsg\u00e5rd, it delivers exactly what it says on the poster - a pair of iconic monsters duking it out in the most epic way possible ...and very little else.Sometime after the events of \"Godzilla: King of the Monsters\", the giant ape Kong is being kept under surveillance inside a large simulated habitat, forming a bond with a deaf girl who communicates with him through sign language. One day, Godzilla attacks a city in Florida for seemingly no reason and this sparks an international debate over whether or not these huge monsters are a threat to humanity's future. A team of experts soon deduce that Godzilla was actually tracking Kong's energy signal and decide to transport him somewhere secret in an effort to prevent the two of them from fighting each other and causing even more collateral damage.When it comes to giant monster movies, you can't go too wrong with the ones featuring the undisputed king of the monsters himself - Godzilla. Since 1954, this giant reptilian has been stomping his way through cities battling various monsters of similar size with his brute strength and trademark atomic breath. Every time I hear Godzilla's signature roar, it gives me chills like the first time hearing a lightsaber turning on in \"Star Wars\" or the DeLorean from \"Back to the Future\" reaching 88 miles per hour. Likewise, the enormous gorilla Kong has also had his fair share of time in the spotlight, debuting all the way back in 1933 in the classic film \"King Kong\". With this in mind, it seems fitting that these two iconic titans of east and west should face off against each other at some point, having previously done so in 1962's \"King Kong vs. Godzilla\". Now in 2021, we have a brand new reimagining of such a rivalry, complete with better special effects and destruction galore. There's something so mindlessly satisfying in seeing giant monsters beating the hell out of each other while leaving heavy destruction in their wake. I guess it's all just part of the entertainment value we can take away knowing it's all in good fun and that we can be thankful such colossal creatures don't exist in real life. However, if you are expecting to be treated to anything else beyond this, you will be greatly disappointed. Regardless, if fighting monsters and gratuitous demolition of skyscrapers is what you crave, then this movie certainly delivers.In addition to this, the film also touches on the mythology of these strange beasts (known as \"Kaiju\" in Japanese), with particular focus placed on Kong and his origins. I'm no expert on Kaiju lore or anything like that but I did enjoy that we got to see how these towering figures aren't evil beings with a lust for destroying everything, but rather neutral parties trying to establish their place at the top of the monster food chain. Of course, the level of neutrality varies for each of the two, with Kong perhaps being \"True Neutral\" and Godzilla being \"Chaotic Neutral\". For example, Kong is seen attempting to live peacefully on Skull Island under the pretense that he is in charge and nothing else can take that away from him. Later on, when Godzilla arrives to challenge this notion, an all out brawl ensues, much like how predator animals like big cats would fight one another to establish dominance. We are informed it has been like this for thousands of years and that human civilisation has only popped up recently, just being on the brink of learning how to co-exist among all this ongoing conflict.There's not much to say about the film's human characters, as they are only there to help move the small remnants of the plot along. Most of them were either generic military personnel marked for death or scientific minds trying to make sense of all this madness. I suppose Millie Bobby Brown was the only actor in the film with some dimension to her, as anyone who saw 2019's \"Godzilla: King of the Monsters\" will recall her character and her importance in that story. I did also like the film's scenes with the deaf girl talking to Kong via sign language, as this reminded me of the famous gorilla Koko who was taught how to communicate with her trainers through similar means. In spite of all this, by the end of the movie, I couldn't recall a single name of anybody other than the titular monsters, remembering them by the actor's real names instead of their characters. At the same time though, it didn't really matter because at the end of the day we don't pay to see a giant monster movie for the human characters for the same reason we don't go to McDonald's to order a filet mignon. Godzilla and Kong's names are in the film's title and it should be obvious by now that they are the real stars here, not the humans.As far as giant monster movies go, \"Godzilla vs. Kong\" does a serviceable job at entertaining us with frequent action and great special effects. It's mind numbingly simplistic but I wouldn't expect anything less. At this stage, it is unknown if there will be any more films in this \"MonsterVerse\" but I do see potential in the franchise continuing for as long as the demand is there. Since there are still plenty of threatening monsters out there to be dealt with, I remain hopeful.I rate it 6.5/10"}, {"reviewer_name": "jp_91", "date": "8 April 2021", "text": "\"Godzilla vs. Kong\" is a weak film with a bad script.

The boy, the particular reason I hated Deadpool 2 now achieved the impossible: that he hated American movies about monsters with an inclusive cast. Of the others only one sentence: I wanted them all dead in the first frame. Everyone, their parents and their grandparents. I wanted everything to explode in the film, and in the final fight they would wipe out humanity, starting especially with those involved with the production of this slug, this crap, this cinematographic insult. Finally: Godzilla has no neck and has a microcephalic head. I don't know who came up with it that this is how the king of monsters should look. Godzilla for that anatomy couldn't even look to the side without having to rotate the body. King Kong using weapons is as if it were an extension of past films with apes conquering the world inaugurated by Charlton Heston. No Hollywood, don't do it anymore. Stop doing garbage. Stop insulting our intelligence and pockets. Stay away from this movie at all costs, well-shot fights aren't worth everything behind and around them.

After years of waiting these two iconic characters to appear on the big screen facing off one another, this long-awaited sequel is finally here to rumble but will it be a gigantic pay off or a gargantuan turn off?Question #1: Are there a lot of action-packed scenes?I know the majority of the audience who wants to watch this film is expecting a non-stop action packed scenes. With a runtime of approximately 1 hour 52 mins including credits, the film offers a few action scenes but not as plenty as to how the critics are referring to. I feel that Kong: Skull Island and Godzilla: King of the Monsters offer more action scenes than Godzilla vs Kong though this latest film is not left far behind as the final act provides a visual pleasing jaw-dropping fighting scenes. As my expectation is high, to say that the film offers 'enough' action scenes is an overstatement but it still manages to be enjoyable overall.Question #2: Are there any fighting monsters other than Godzilla and Kong?Yes, there are a few but it serves more as a filler than getting a part in the main storytelling. Without mentioning which or who, there is an appearance of a monster during the final battle of the movie but I feel that there is much more that can be done with it. It lacks any development and it is hard not to think that the monster is there just to be there without moving forward its story or origin. It leaves an impression that other than Godzilla and Kong, other monsters serve mainly to remind the audience that this is a Monster Verse.Question #3: Is the visual effect as outstanding as what the critics are saying?Oh yes, the visual effect is outstanding. You can witness the figure of the monsters with dazzling spectacle. It feels very much real and alive and it is difficult to spot the flaws in terms of its visual. I can bet high that this film will receive a nomination for next year's awards like Oscars and Golden Globes for Best Visual Effects of the year.Question #4: What do I like about Godzilla vs Kong?The best thing about Godzilla vs Kong for me is the cinematography during the ongoing action scenes. It lets you witness the event by means of a point-of-view technique as if you are about to go to an amusement park ride. It is effectively entertaining, it buckles you on your seat to let you experience the ride and immerse yourself in the experience. The choreography of the action scenes between the monsters is also left to be amazed. It shows you never-before-seen battle movements that are eye-pleasing to watch alongside the color palette which is mesmerizing, it is hard not to think the Pacific Rim universe when you see the colorful and bright neon lights showering the Monster Verse world. I also love the intrinsic and humane expression of Kong and the grisly horrific images of Godzilla, it shows both ends of spectrum, complementing Yin & Yang.Question #5: What do I dislike about Godzilla vs Kong?Other than what I feel that it contains only a few action scenes, the plot moves towards uninteresting territory. This is the problem with the Godzilla films for me, instead of capturing the audience with an appealing plot, it shows you on the process of fighting against or helping the monsters. It establishes the idea to guide you through the journey of survival if we were being attacked with the monsters which sets aside its storytelling. I get it, it is a film about fighting monsters but there is a reason why the first Godzilla film does not receive much appraisal as it lacks both storytelling and action scenes. Furthermore, I also feel that the middle part of the film feels a bit draggy and over-the-top ridiculous with no sci-fi boundaries. I also feel disengaged by the chemistry between Godzilla and Kong because it seems that there were there to only fight without a proper explanation. Godzilla is only present when he is about to battle, no more and no less.Question #6: Who should watch Godzilla vs Kong?Those who:-Have invested in the previous Monster Verse films.Want to watch brainless popcorn flicks and can suspend their disbelief.Want to be impressed by its jaw-dropping visual spectacle.Want to witness monsters fight.Question #7: Is there any end credits scene?Unfortunately, there is no end credits scenes after or during the credits roll.Question #8: Rate the Monster Verse films from Best to Good (There's no worst, every film is entertaining and good.)Godzilla: King of the MonstersKong: Skull IslandGodzilla vs KongGodzillaVerdict: Godzilla vs Kong sets to shake the world with its massive fighting scenes and dazzling visual effect and while those succeed, it seems that the roaring rumble is stepped down by the lack of action scenes in the first two acts and the uncharted exploration of its mythology that makes Godzilla vs Kong an only substantially sizeable monster mayhem film."}, {"reviewer_name": "dennis-vranic", "date": "26 March 2021", "text": "OK, so maybe I am biased as have always been avid Godzilla fan but this movie was everything I expected.

I'm biased, as I'm a lifelong Godzilla fan and 2. I actually knew spoilers FAR ahead of time for this movie.That being said, I thought this film ruled. It's by far my favorite movie in the Monsterverse, if not flat out my favorite movie period. The CGI and sound design for this film are phenomenal, there wasn't a single scene where I though \"yeah, that CGI could use some touchups.\" Both monsters look incredible and are done absolute justice here. To make this more readable, I've split this review into parts.Kong:\nKong is most certainly the main character of the movie. The film starts with him, and once he's with Team Kong, there isn't really a scene that he's not in. It's absurd the amount of detail that goes into Kong's facial expressions. His reactions are honestly a highlight of the movie, I actively noticed myself searching his face to see what he was thinking. Kong is also most definitely the heart of the film, as even with myself being a Godzilla fan, I cared immensely for Kong and was emotionally with him for the ups and downs. Whether you are a fan of him or not, this film will have you loving Monke by the end.Godzilla:\nWhile not having anywhere near the screentime as Kong, Godzilla still ruled this movie for me (bias obviously in play). His opening sequence screams classic Godzilla, and the way he looks and fights in this movie are absolutely brutal. This movie nailed giving Godzilla this foreboding atmosphere, anytime he's on screen it spells doom. I also have to say that he essentially stole the show at all the set pieces he was apart of.Humans:\nColored me surprised, but I actually didn't dislike the human characters in this movie. I went in fully expecting the character levels we got in King of the Monsters, but I genuinely cannot say that I hated anyone in this movie. Does that mean that they're incredibly fleshed out characters with Godfather levels of dialogue. Absolutely not, but where the last film had a lot of family drama, this one has a lot of humor and heart. The two main standouts to me are Tyree's character and Jia, which I think works as they're essentially the most important character for their respective team.Ending thoughts:\nI was going to write more for this, but I decided to leave the review as a spoiler free one. Like I said, I loved this movie, it has a lot of action and seriously fast pace (both of which are a big thumbs up for me). If you're a fan of either of these characters, or even just looking for a fun time, this film is definitely worth a watch."}, {"reviewer_name": "daredevilu", "date": "24 March 2021", "text": "GODzilla Vs KINGkong .

I remember seeing Godzilla and King Kong duke it out as a kid. It was epic. Those fights were a lot less costly.Who would win the fight is what we all wanted to know right? Smart money would've bet on Godzilla, but GvK tried its best to make King Kong a sympathetic character thereby deserving to win. King Kong had a special link with a deaf girl named Jia (Kaylee Hottle) which automatically makes King Kong the David in his fight against Goliath. The relationship between them was a little weird and a lot dangerous. Jia's mom (or guardian), Ilene Andrews (Rebecca Hall), seemed to have no problem with her young daughter (or charge) fraternizing with a 100 foot gorilla. Friendly or not, accidents happen.Bad parenting aside, we got the fight that was promised. I didn't enjoy it nearly as much as I expected and the city of Hong Kong didn't enjoy it at all.

It finally finds that proper Godzilla feel. People seem to love complaining about the nonsensical convoluted plot to this film, but personally I found the absurdity to be right in line with a Godzilla movie. To all those complaining, I have to assume they just don't understand how truly off the rails and wacky Godzilla really is. This film went entirely in the right direction by building this universe into something more fantasy driven and opening up the door to have future stories become much more bizarre and cosmic, aliens are coming, I can feel it. I was growing tired of the overly serious plot lines of the previous movies, constantly trying to force humans to be the main characters in stories that just completely get in the way and offer nothing of interest. Godzilla Vs. Kong on the other hand finally introduces personality to the kaiju. In all the previous movies everything was constantly from the perspective of these painfully boring stories of the humans, leaving the kaiju feeling like nothing more then generic monsters, with subtle implications that Godzilla may be more sentient then a mere force of destruction but never actually making godzilla a character. It's like watching a Thor movie from the perspective of a random group of asgardians chasing after some mcguffin while thor is in the background fighting. Finally this movie starts to break the logic of humans being the important part, the kaiju are the main characters here, the humans are the side plot, and THAT is what it's meant to be. I go into a Godzilla movie expecting to see larger then life monster beat the crap out of each other and smash stuff while the humans do some nonsensical science stuff to help a monster save the day from another monster, and this movie fully in all ways delivers on that."}, {"reviewer_name": "hcfernandezpa", "date": "2 April 2021", "text": "Wow!!!

Followed up by the average Kong: Skull Island, I started to lose interest in them making this into a franchise. For some reason though, even though critics weren't too pleased with Godzilla: King of the Monsters, I found that to be the most enjoyable of the three. It had been known from the beginning that a film down the road would pit both Godzilla and King Kong against one another. Personally, I found Godzilla vs. Kong to be leaps and bounds better than the previous three installments. Now available in select theatres and on-demand, here are my thoughts on Godzilla vs. Kong.When going into a film like Godzilla vs. Kong, you shouldn't be expecting to see the greatest story ever put to film. It's a movie about two popular monsters brawling it out. For that reason alone, I would suggest going into this film just looking to have some fun. The title promises a fight and there is a lot of action to be enjoyed here. For a movie called Godzilla vs. Kong, however, there is very little Godzilla outside of the action. This actually ended up being a positive for me though.I wasn't expecting this film to dive so deeply into the mythology of King Kong. This is basically a King Kong film, that still lives up to the promise of him fighting Godzilla. The human characters are either there to serve King Kong and provide some genuine drama, or simply to be some comedic relief when bouncing back to the side of Godzilla. The visuals involving King Kong's storyline and the in-depth exploration are really what put this film over just being a film about creatures fighting. This added lore really helped my enjoyment, making me much more invested.Whether you're talking about You're Next or Death Note, director Adam Wingard is a filmmaker that I've never really latched onto. Other than his stellar work on The Guest, none of his films really impressed me. I've always admired his style though and that is very much present here, along with the best aspects of his direction. He keeps everything moving along at a very nice pace and I never once found myself bored. It also didn't hurt that he had an insanely talented cast alongside him. From the return of Millie Bobby Brown as Madison to the introduction of young Kaylee Hottle as Jia, and even to the comedic relief of Brian Tyree Henry as Bernie this cast either had me engaged or laughing, even though they weren't really pivotal to the core story.Overall, Godzilla vs. Kong delivers exactly what the title promises, never skimping on the action or visual effects. They spend much more time making you believe King Kong is the hero and that Godzilla is the threat, so if you're someone who wants to choose sides, that may make it a little difficult. This film isn't one to pick apart in terms of minor inconsistencies, because it literally exists to give audiences a fun fight. Does the film have zero regard for who dies in the streets while these two are going at it? Absolutely not, but it's a blast to watch. Godzilla vs. Kong is far from a perfect movie, but it perfectly executes what it wants to, and for that, I absolutely recommend checking it out."}, {"reviewer_name": "tccandler", "date": "1 April 2021", "text": "Make no mistake, this is an animated movie.

Best actors have cameos while unknown kids perform school play acting. No heart in this long dragged out film. Plot has potential but needs better re-writes because it supposedly sequels 2 better movies - Kong Skull island & Godzilla: King of monsters. This film corrupts what's good in both films re main beasts. Kong becomes more human & then more vicious w/ boosted roar like screams. Godzilla Regresses to a 70's lizard w/ no brain & less power, losing his iconic roar but gaining slanted eyes. No dumb blonde, just mainly young kids having the power to save the world from a greedy mega corp Monarch that's surprisingly still in business. The big fight scene occurs in Hong Kong, hundreds of structures are affected yet all are strangely empty. No govt is involved in this global \"chase.\" There's also another new hidden world that becomes a tourist type attraction - ridiculous concept, except for another sequel.I like both beasts, but making them \"eternal enemies\" is senseless with Kong, an American icon, who edges out Godzilla in key ways, esp using his new historic Excalibur like ax. This sadly reflects the ongoing anti Asian hate in this country, blaming a Japanese created beast for global disease problems.

On one side, there's the American tradition of capturing the movie that is the racialized stand-in for the \"other,\" King Kong. And on the other, there's the Japanese window-framed fiction made out of its horrific atomic-bombed past, Godzilla. How do these two national cinematic traditions react to each other? They fight over trade routes--shipping lanes, air cargo, and high-tech portals--and the ultimate destination of the Chinese market. Figures.But doesn't Hong Kong have its own vibrant filmmaking industry, you may ask? Apparently, some seem to think it a multinational mess spearheaded by some foreign vague impression of a baddie that results in some abomination that's transparently mechanical and divorced of any organic origins. Is it a surprise that Legendary Pictures has become a subsidiary of a Chinese conglomerate. Draw your own conclusions about the shared destruction of Hong Kong, as the rest of the human audience to the monsters-as-movies sit comfortably (or try to, at least) behind their safety-glass screens and virtual-reality domes. Same-day premieres on HBO Max help there.I don't know what one gets out of this stuff if not an allegory for the movie-making process of pitting CGI monstrosities against each other as they demolish virtual environments. This Godzilla and Kong have become so devoid of their original meanings that the giant lizard eats bombs, and the people mostly love them, too, and the giant ape slaves away to serve his colonialist captors battling whatever lizardy creature they insist he battles and is so sexless that he only communicates with a child. And the human so-called characters are as vacant as Godzilla and Kong's gazes into each others' digital eye holes (no wonder the biggest stars have since bailed on the series). They're the opposites of their former selves--Hollow Earth to be reformed by corporate social Darwinists in their machinations to wreak havoc over bigger and bigger markets. It's a disaster.I do rather like, however, the beginning of putting Kong in a virtual-reality, or movie, dome that he begins smashing, which is later reflected in the shots of shattering glass. Note that in \"Skull Island\" (2017) and, indeed, in the original \"King Kong\" (1933) that the monster is \"captured\" by film. Hence, the characters who are filmmakers, photographers or otherwise exhibitors. In 1933, he literally broke from his shackles on a stage. So, in \"Godzilla vs. Kong,\" they've since captured him in a movie. His own movie, or at least as best as they can pretend it, but he's soon to break out or be placed in the wider movie of the Monsterverse--the world or windows and international markets, as it was in the 2014 \"Godzilla\" and the 2019 \"King of the Monsters.\" I've got to respect the consistency, if not the faint purpose."}, {"reviewer_name": "jasoncondie", "date": "24 March 2021", "text": "One of the best movies of the year.. better story line than the past 2 Godzilla movies, and keeps you interested the whole way through."}, {"reviewer_name": "guruprashanth-40867", "date": "24 March 2021", "text": "This is the best monsterverse movie in my opinion, movies specially made for monsterverse fan and if you are a fan of kong you will surely enjoy the movie from start to end, kong presence made every negatives in the movie forgettable, first half of the movie is lacking but after the end you will be fully satisfied, dont care about what critics saying and if you are a fan you will surely love the movie."}, {"reviewer_name": "burhanrizwan", "date": "24 March 2021", "text": "I love this movie Aweosome acting and love this movie this is one of my favourite movie and believe you will also love it.Love and peace"}, {"reviewer_name": "cjonesas", "date": "2 April 2021", "text": "\"Godzilla vs. Kong\" is a fantastic movie, better watched in the biggest screen possible, thus the theaters.

Undoubtedly, when the first King Kong vs Godzilla (1962) movie was released by the Japanese, it created a sensation. Though Gojira (Godzilla) was their creation, however, they were able to present a fair fight between these two legendary titans. Both Kong and Godzilla have their advantages and disadvantages and it's not easy to pick one clear winner. That's why the Japanese production highlighted on the key fighting instincts of both Kong and Godzilla and tried to show a fight which was really enjoyable with a fair outcome. Moreover, they did not really make either of the fan groups feel humiliated about their hero.On the other hand, the Hollywood production clearly stated a definite winner in the trailer by highlighting \"One Will Fall\". In a way of doing so, they made the Kong look really vulnerable and almost a no-match against Godzilla. This is highly unacceptable as there are so many ways in which Kong could beat Godzilla by using his intelligence and human like capabilities (i.e. Using anything as a weapon) whereas in the entire last fight Kong is seen relying only on a prehistoric axe which even needs to be charged by the atomic breath of the G-monster.It seemed a highly childish fight plot where Warner Bros made Godzilla fans happy first of all by showing that he could have finished Kong just like that, nonetheless he chose not to. Then to make Kong fans happy, the Mecha G appears and beats the hell out of Godzilla which made the Kong fans somewhat content. However, since this does not give enough satisfaction to the Kong fans, they made Kong re-appear with his axe and finish off the MechaG by himself and thus saving Godzilla. I mean, what's the whole point in this fighting plot! Was it Godzilla vs Kong or was it a Handicap One on Two match from WWE? It's just a recap of Batman vs. Superman in the disguise of Kong and Zilla. Disappointing!I will not go into the story, CGI or making of the movie etc. Because those are good enough according to the standards of 2021, so, no comments on that but if you want to remake a classic 60s movie then do that by keeping the originality of the movie.

I'm not used to this! I'm used to pirating movies online!\"\nPersonal Anecdote:\nThe last movie I saw in theatres was Sonic The Hedgehog on Valentine's day in 2020.This is officially my first film back into a theatre since, and me and a group of friends rented out an entire theatre to be covid safe.This was already one of my most anticipated movies of the year when it got announced (I didn't watch a single trailer to make the film as fresh as possible), but back in the beginning of March I watched all the Showa Era Godzilla films and woke up the inner Godzilla fanboy in me.This was by far the most excited i've been for a film since Avengers: Endgame.Review:\nGodzilla vs. Kong absolutely knocked it out of the park with enormous kaiju battles, an entertaining story, with some stunning visuals and sound design.The human-side plot was enthralling and way more entertaining than Godzilla: King of the Monsters, the human characters are greatly improved and have more depth to them, and their story has way more of an impact on the world at large. The world building in this film is next level and I would love to see Warner Bros. / Legendary Studios to continue building off of this world even more than they already have.I did have an issue with some lazy storytelling and a few awkward character moments, but it was nothing that ever took me out of the film.The visuals absolutely blew me away, the cinematography was great and there are a handful of shots in this that are just beautiful to look at, but it also translates over to the big fights, where some scenes are shot from below giving a real sense of scale with just how huge these monsters are.Seeing our God, Godzilla, and our King, King Kong, go head-to-head was breathtaking. The fights were super impactful and heavy, they practically level an entire city fighting each other. The \"Neon City Fight\" was probably my favorite, and is definitely the best kaiju fight i've ever seen.This is exactly what you want in a Godzilla film. Even though this tends to be more of a Kong film, with majority of the film following Kong around and focusing the story mainly around him, I can't not give my man Gojira credit, he absolutely steals the show.Godzilla vs. Kong by all means isn't a perfect film, it has its flaws for sure, but it's the best dumb fun i've ever experienced. It's. So. Much. Fun.It isn't too heavy on the human side, has huge, extremely entertaining fights, and some great visuals.

'Godzilla vs. Kong' has a few things working against it, including the fact that it has to come up with a half-baked plot to string things together, even though the real selling point is seeing two classic monsters go toe-to-toe with each other. Sure, a standard plot is probably necessary, but one could argue that a full 113 minutes of building smashing and body slamming would've been a better product that what we get here.Sure, it's cool to see Millie Bobby Brown reprise her role as a monster-crazed teen, but she was relegated to almost a cameo to make room for others to clog up the screen, like Alexander Skarsgard and a young actress who portrays a deaf girl native to Skull Island. There's even more jumping around to all corners of the planet here, to the point where teleportation or apparation must actually be a thing. And don't even think about trying to make sense of anything (not that you would, given the subject matter).The most disappointing part of 'Godzilla vs. Kong' is the ending.

They already delivered the year's one of the most awaited (and longest) action blockbusters with Zack Snyder's Justice League, and have now delivered another eye-popping, heart-stopping, jaw-dropping action blockbuster, Godzilla vs. Kong. It's no spoiler that the film centers on the epic clash between the two eponymous giant creatures, and the result is a massively entertaining film which reminds us why cinema going used to be such a pleasant experience in the pre-COVID times.It has decent human characters as well, and they don't feel overshadowed or eat up the entire plot either. Plus, the visuals in this film are so incredibly gorgeous that you can literally pause at any moment to get a magical, otherworldly, surreal wallpaper. The pacing is also a major plus, as the film moves pretty quick and keeps the action coming, with destruction scenes looking as epic as they can. Director Adam Wingard has done a fabulous job with this film, and has managed to deliver what fans of escapist cinema really desire from their movies.The action is intense and the film's big draw, especially the final battle where I was left breathless and could easily imagine crowds of viewers cheering in cinemas at certain moments. The background score accompanying most of the sequences is good, and the visual effects are fantastic. All this makes me want to watch it once again and buy a Blu-ray copy when it becomes available in the future. Even without seeing the 2014 and 2019 Godzilla as well as the 2005 King Kong, I was able to understand the plot and enjoy it without being bored for even a second.Although the story is as simple as it can get, Godzilla vs Kong's success in captivating you with its all-out action spectacle is a reminder that cinema is first and foremost an escapist experience, and films that do this notion justice are lapped up more easily by majority of the viewers. No doubt this film too has passed the test with flying colors and has satisfied many fans craving this kind of popcorn-friendly fun.

Of the shared universes currently out there, one of the more consistent is the Monsterverse, a world where the most iconic kaiju coexist. Now, it all culminates into an epic crossover, one I've waited for a very long time: \"Godzilla vs Kong\".Plot: A period of peace suddenly comes to a halt when Godzilla mysteriously goes on a rampage. Monarch is approached by Apex to convince the now fully grown Kong to help search for a solution in the Hollow Earth. This puts the two alpha titans on a collision course, one that will determine who will be the true King of the Monsters.The minds behind the Monsterverse took a page from Marvel in carefully planning out this eventually crossover, building on what started with \"Godzilla (2014)\" in all the right ways and paying off spectacularly. The story is well-paced and told even with the 2-hour runtime, feeling like all parties involved get their due. The main human cast, consisting of three factions, are simplistic but decent and contribute to the story in varying degrees, especially towards the end. I came to like their interactions, some comedic and others having a little weight behind them. They also help explain what's going on with the monsters when needed. Easily the heart of them is Jia, a deaf Skull Island native bonded with Kong who communicates via sign language. Her expressions really sell it when a scene calls for it, leading to some touching moments like one she shares with the big ape during the rain. Only two minor characters come up short in terms of potential and overall roles. While not as deep as previous entries in terms of story and themes, the film does explore the value of trust, reflected in different ways among the cast, human and monster, as the story progresses.At the center are the monsters as one would expect. Kong is the arguable protagonist as he goes on an epic journey of discovery wrought with trials and tribulations. You feel the raw emotion as he goes through tough times. While having less screen time, Godzilla is given as much respect. He truly feels powerful and menacing as a force of nature should, though he's also sympathetic when his motives are understood. Whenever they battle, it lives up to the hype; both have clearly defined fighting styles, lots of back and forth as each deals heavy blows with everything around them being utterly wrecked. Unlike in the OG film, this clash of titans has a clear winner. There are other monsters, including a famous Godzilla character that's executed brilliantly in design, portrayal, and sheer power. The environments are pure eye candy from the neon-lit Hong Kong giving stunning illumination to the wondrous Hollow Earth with its unusual wildlife and trippy landscapes. Junkie XL's music is another highlight, capturing the scope of the film and giving each monster their own musical cues based on which is more dominant on screen. I also dig the many nods to previous movies like an iconic moment from the OG version. The cinematography is top notch; much as I love suitmation, the CGI allows for incredible angles to make the fights more visually grand like brief POV shots from Kong and underwater scenes. My only gripe is that the film does cut a few corners, mainly where the aforementioned humans are concerned with a few missed opportunities.\"Godzilla vs Kong\" is like a roller coaster, starting off slow to set the mood and then becomes a thrill right with constant action. Watching my childhood heroes duking it out got me giddy in my seat. This is an event that lived up to expectations and then some. It's certainly better put together than \"Batman v Superman\" which tried to do too much at once. It's not the deepest Monsterverse film, but it's sure to please.

I can't think of a single way in which the sub-plot had any affect on the film's conclusion. This would be less of an issue if the dialogue or characters in this part of the story were entertaining, but they are not, all the jokes and minimal attempts at endearing personality fall completely flat. If these numerous scenes were completely cut from the film, it would only improve the film by making it less boring and more concise.You know you're watching a bad film, when by the half-way point you start asking yourself why certain characters are even in it, then you realise they are there to literally just fill the running-time and nothing else.There isn't even an attempt at a coherent story, with cause and effect. It's just a series of scenes which make very little effort to explain why anything that's happening is happening. I'd like to say it might be passable for very young kids, but unfortunately I think even they might find it boring.And I just can't agree with all the people who are saying \"watch it for the battles\" either, they are thoroughly generic with nothing to make them stand-out. Even if the CG scenes are exciting for a lot of people, in this day and age, I don't see why we should let producers off putting at least a little effort into engaging characters and dialogue, considering the hundreds of millions of dollars spent.Terrible film.

Instead they try to worldbuild a serious sci fi drama around a \"cute\" concept. And it just doesn't work. If they made it as sci fi comedies, mixing some practical effects like guys in suits with the cgi destruction, then it would retain that charm.For all the millions they spend on cgi spectacle, they can't buy charm. These new movies are not charming. They are loud, dumb and pretentious. That goes especially for the previous one (the first one actually held back on the spectacle and managed to build some suspense before everything went dumb).

Kong is kept in captivity inside a dome on Skull Island. Meanwhile, Godzilla attacks the Pensacola facility of Apex Cybernetics where Bernie Hayes who hosts a podcast about Titan conspiracy theories is extracting data. To combat the fire-breathing lizard, the humans use Kong as a weapon in case Godzilla shows up again and to go to the Hollow Earth and find out what is causing Godzilla to go on rampages.This is the fourth movie in Legendary's MonsterVerse which began with Gareth Edwards' Godzilla in 2014. It was originally supposed to come out last year, but it was pushed back due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Released in both theaters and on HBO Max, this movie gained a lot of attention when the trailer was released. In fact, the trailer for Godzilla vs. Kong broke the record for becoming the biggest trailer debut ever for Warner Bros (Outlaw, January 2021). This movie had some hype to live up to. After seeing this film in theaters, I thought it did quite a good job.When coming to a big action-blockbuster film, it is expected to see the titular characters duking out with other monsters. The problem with the first two American Godzilla films is that there was too much focus on the human characters and not enough on the monsters. Kong: Skull Island was better in this regard, but it still had its problems. In Godzilla vs Kong, they duke it out.While the first 20 or 30 minutes might be a little slow, once Godzilla and King Kong fight on the aircraft carrier, the movie becomes a non-stop action-packed thrill ride. The two titans are going at it. They are biting, punching and using the environment around them to smash each other. No awkward cuts. No annoying transitions. Just the blissful battles that I wanted. The action is stunning in the film from the way the sequences are shot and edited. The battle at the aircraft carrier is one of the best action scenes I have seen from a blockbuster in a while. The fight is relentless and the focus is mostly on Godzilla and Kong. Neither of them let the other breathe for even a minute. It actually got quite intense. The climactic battle in Hong Kong is also stunning. It is beautifully lit and energetic.As for the visuals, they improved from the last few films. There are so many shots that just show the scale of not just monsters, but the environments around them. Even Kong looks like an ant compared to the Hollow Earth, despite getting a size upgrade. The colors look beautiful and the neon city sticks out. The effects on the two monsters are as impressive as ever and they have vivid expressions. There is one scene where Godzilla glares down Kong with what looks like pure hatred in his eyes. It gives them more weight than just being the two monsters that fight. Details like this make the fights more engaging and intense.I have been praising this film a lot, but the story is its weakness. While it is better than Godzilla: King of the Monsters in both its structure and pacing, it still has a corny plot. It is mostly used as an excuse to get the two monsters to battle each other. The movie moves at such a fast pace that it does not slow down for that much character development. Aside from the young child who has an adorable relationship with Kong and her mother, I did not care too much about the human characters.Luckly, they are not the focus of the movie. The monsters are the focus. King Kong is the most interesting part of the film, especially with his friendship with the deaf little girl. However, Kong got much more development than Godzilla did which was a bit disappointing. There are a couple of twists and surprises for fans and the introduction of a new monster in the second act. However, there is no end-credit scene to indicate what direction the MonsterVerse will head to next.While Godzilla vs. Kong is not without its faults, it makes for one heck of an action film. It delivers on its title and it features some of the best action scenes and visuals from a blockbuster in a while. However, the story is not that great and the characters are forgettable. Not everyone will enjoy this film because of the problems with the story. However, I got exactly what I wanted from this film. I felt the intensity and scale of the monsters while watching this film and I was never bored for even a minute."}, {"reviewer_name": "redrobin62-321-207311", "date": "3 April 2021", "text": "Sitting through \"Godzilla vs. Kong\" was like watching clouds form in the sky, and actually, that would've been time better spent.

Almost every scene was completely implausible, from the idiot army generals who have to be told what to do my a primatologist, to the sheer ridiculousness of the Hollow Earth Jurassic Park.

The premise of the film sees the two biggest Titans Godzilla and Kong have to collide in order to determine who is the true king.Main Character\nFor me this film focuses more on Kong then Godzilla and I am okay with that and Kong is handled really well in this film. He is given a sense of humanity and I really grew to care about Kong and wanted to see him get a happy ending and it is so entertaining seeing him in the action scenes. Godzilla isn't given as much character as Kong but he is still great and I will never get bored of seeing him in all of his epic glory which the film does really well.Supporting Characters\nMillie Bobby Brown is back from the previous film and I thought she was decent in her role here. The character's story doesn't work and is part of a larger problem but she gives it her all and a fun performance which is rare to see in these films. Rebecca Hall plays a new character who is more linked to Kong and she is good in her role, she just fits it very well with the character and I just thought she was decent in the role. Though the rest of the cast do suffer, Alexander Skarsgard plays a scientist and I just feel like he was miscast in this role, I just never bought him in the role and it didn't help that his character was bland and not once are you ever given any reason to care about him or his task. Then all the human villains are as generic as they come, Eiza Gonzalez is totally wasted and I just wish more was done there. Also Brian Tyree Henry and Julian Dennison are in the film, mostly as comic relief but for me despite their obvious talent it just didn't work here and I am guessing that is mostly down to the writing.Story\nThe story is okay, I really liked Kong's story and how they made him a way more sympathetic character and it made the clashes with Godzilla have more weight to them and make at least some of the fights have more context and investment towards them. But my biggest issue with the plot is just how safe it plays it, no spoilers but if you watched the trailer for this film then you can predict the film in a pretty easy way and that is a big let down. Especially, when I think there was more interesting things that could have been done here.Script\nThe script does have some okay drama to it and it had real heart which the previous films failed at. But the overall writing for the plot is very weak and I guess I jut wanted a bit more then the film gave me and there is way more humour in this film but I see why they avoided it as it isn't well done here at all.Style\nThis is the one part the film has to get right and I am happy to report that this film is great to look at. The fight scenes between Godzilla and Kong is brilliant and feels huge in nature which is all you can ask for with a film like this. The film is also paced well, it is less then 2 hours and that makes the film feel more often and keeps the film moving at a nice pace.Overall\nOverall, Godzilla vs Kong is a good film that delivers on the aspects of the film that it wanted to. For me it is probably the best film in the monster verse and if this is the end then it can go out on a high."}, {"reviewer_name": "radufl", "date": "1 April 2021", "text": "What a waste of time and money.

They clearly didn't try to make any meaningful adjustments.Monster/kaiju movies that work have two directions they can go: make a meaningful commentary about the state of the world (a la original Godzilla re: metaphor for nuclear fallout trauma) or be so knowingly silly with the action/destruction that the humans don't really factor into the equation. This tries so hard to be self-serious that it becomes a satire of itself in a bad way. The bleach consuming jokes don't even make sense.

Like the first scene where Kong eats some fish looks absolutely laughable. And a lot of the fight scenes do too. KOTM looked a lot better. A lot of the sizes don't stay the same throughout the film either. One thing I will say, I a that the human side was better in this film than KOTM.

There is talk of rituals of years gone by and the film also owes something of a debt to the plot of Batman vs. Superman, but at no point is it convincing that any of this has to happen, other than the fact that the VFX people have come up with a pretty convincing Kong and Godzilla.We get almost an hour in before we see the monsters themselves, and by that point, most of the interesting dialogue has been spoken - and that's really saying something - but the studio knows that what audiences really want to see is the fight sequences. In that regard, the film works. The fight sequences are of a huge scale and are full of thwack, vim and vigour. Fortunately, the monsters never lose their sense of size and there are some really visually striking shots of the two going at it.As fun as the fight scenes are, the film does make one fatally bad decision. Without going into any detail what I can say is that based on the majority of comments across social media about which of the two monsters should win, in the end, the wrong one does. Visually and technically, the film is more than satisfactory, but creatively it is not rewarding enough. The characters are disposable, the script seems like an after-thought, and the film isn't saved by its ending.Godzilla vs. Kong will no doubt make a lot of money, but I don't think we are quite there in terms of a film about the world's most infamous movie monsters fighting it out.

The action was of course the best part, the cgi paired with the outrageous fighting sequences creates a tense thriller, each punch has impact, which I adore, so many movies makes the characters feel like they are punching air, not this time! The titan's did feel a bit fast, which increased the flow of the fighting but made them feel smaller.As far as plot, there is none. Bad lizard, good lizard who is thought to be bad and monke. Everything to do with humans is rubbish, it literally adds nothing. The bad guy villain person is just there for being there. Suprisingly godzilla isn't featured in the movie a whole lot, it's really a Kong movie.

On one hand, it gives the fans exactly what they all came looking for, a real battle between the two most powerful forces of nature. But then all of it is ruined by the nonsensical plot & sci-fi claptrap which goes way past the threshold of suspension of disbelief for the viewers to just sit back & enjoy it for what it is.Directed by Adam Wingard (You're Next & The Guest), Godzilla vs. Kong lives up to its name in the sense that it offers an actual mano-a-mano clash between the two legendary monsters with a clear winner emerging in the end. But just about everything else that unfolds around these two behemoths is chock-full of issues. The script is an absolute garbage, devising events & scenarios that are facepalm-inducing. As for the human drama, it isn't just uninteresting this time around but also downright insipid.Compared to its predecessors, this latest chapter dives more into the sci-fi realm but it is never for once intriguing or engaging. The monster mayhem is when the film is at its most enjoyable, plus both the fearsome Godzilla & the mighty Kong get their moment to shine whenever they collide. It is a no-holds-barred slugfest between the two that gets ugly & intense, and is spectacularly shot & glorious to watch. But it also feels like the only thing in the film that has some stability to it, for everything else is an utter mess that's all over the place.Overall, Godzilla vs. Kong is fun & entertaining whenever the titular monsters are battling it out against one another and the anticipation for that iconic clash alone is enough to keep the viewers around till the end. However, every time it shifts its focus on human characters, all the shortcomings plaguing this braindead popcorn entertainer are instantly thrown to the forefront, thus resulting in a cinematic ride that's occasionally thrilling but mostly forgettable.

I have been kind to the previous Godzilla movies (the new ones that is, that are part of the Monsterverse), especially when it came to giving them slack due to issues with the human side of the story they tried to tell. I also felt that Kong Skull Island was a bit of a guilty pleasure! Many great actors, a lot of B-movie tropes and throwbacks and fun al around.But combining these two franchises (once again and with callbacks to the original clash from yesteryear ... many many years ago) and some of the actors involved while adding some new ones ... I can't even begin to express how great I felt this was. From the first frame ... when you see Kong himself, I felt this could be something amazing.Now don't get it twisted! This is not a character piece on humans - you will not find a lot of depth and might say that the villains motivation is quite paper thin ... but all you'd do with that is deriving yourself of so much fun you could have. I was not a big fan of the new Snyder Cut of Justice League. It's good in places and has some issues in others - but I was and am happy for anyone who could just plain enjoy it.Why do I even mention this? Because there seems to be a lot of people not even having seen this movie but trying to bury it, because their feelings got hurt and they try to bully Warner into doing what they want. Generally speaking it is a good thing to listen to your fans ... but this has gone too far. And I talked about this as much as needed! Watch the movie before you rate it and be happy for anyone liking something, even if you can't share their feelings.As a big fan of the Original Godzilla movies and kaiju in general, I personally had no issues with the new Monsterverse going CGI. I know others have their problems with that. It will depend on how you feel. But the movie looks fantastic. Even if the \"story\" itself can't grab your attention and hold it - you can't deny how beautiful it looks.But it is not just that. Even though, there is not much plot and the humans are a side note ... actually why even though? It is the right and proper way to do such a movie! And the dialog is handled very well to say the least. Which comes down to the actors involved in this. Adam Wingard went ahead and did it!

One complaint some people have is the lack of importance of the human characters. That is actually not true. Dr. Nathan. Lind ( Alexander. Skar.sgard) saves Kong not once but twice during the movie ( risking his life in the process), and Kong learns to trust the good humans like Lind not just Jia and Dr. Ilene Andrews ( Rebecca Hall). However, the bad ones like. Mai Simmons ( El.za Gonzalez) get their just rewards. Spoilers ahead; Godzilla is secondary to Kong but you see just how powerful and mean he actually can be.

G: KOTM pushed the ridiculousness almost too far but it was within limits which allow me to rewatch it. But Godzilla vs. Kong has so much ridiculousness that it was barely watchable once. The only thing which kept me engaged was the expectations of watching the titans. So much was bad. We can include the dialog with that. But what really bothered me is using the hollow earth idea as a major plot device. I'm not going into details but the hollow earth idea has been disproven for a long time but especially so with modern technology. Given that the movie's story is on earth and that the existence of titans is already a lot, adding more absurdities breaks my ability to maintain interest. It was also bothersome that a couple of whack jobs were given substantial screen time. One was the hollow earth guy and the other was spewing so much stupidity. Just one example is the fluoride as mind control crap. They could have made this work so much better if they kept the fantastical elements about the titans. But they threw in so much crap. By the way, where were the rest of the titans from the end of the last movie? Why only Godzilla and Kong? That did not seem to be explained. Anyway, I personally have unpleasant feelings for having watched this movie. It's not as bad as an Asylum movie but close.They compound dumb ideas with even more dumb ideas in the last part of the movie. The existence of hollow earth and how they got there is already bad. But Godzilla actually creates a hole to the hollow earth with his energy breath. That was a really WTF moment. But it gets worse when it only took a few minutes. And Kong, who somehow survived his fall to H. E. while humans needed a special machine, is also able to fall out of H. E. So he was able to both fall into and out of hollow earth. Oh, the fall out was way faster than falling in.And Godzilla is villainous in this movie, contrary to what some reviewers indicate. He does attack and try to kill Kong early on. The only provocation is that he somehow detects Kong in the open. Godzilla's attack winds up killing thousands of people. This is based on the number of ships which he destroyed, including an aircraft carrier. Even later, It is shown that he attacked the Florida facility because he somehow detected megagodzilla being tested. So Godzilla basically attacks anything which is titan-like even if there is no action which warrants it. His previous experience with facilities and ships showed him that people would have been killed during his attacks. Even his actions in Hong Kong was more like a predator, making the villain a little less villainous.I'm going to stop now. Some of the other negative reviews cover more of the nonsensical elements of this movie. This movie further reinforces my desire to basically stop watching sci-fi movies unless I know with certainty that they are good. We support this kind of trash by even watching it once."}, {"reviewer_name": "christianblawson", "date": "28 March 2021", "text": "See it on the biggest screen as possible.

And they're the last ones standing.\"The epic battle between two of the greatest monsters in cinema has arrived. Godzilla vs. Kong has the fearsome Godzilla and the mighty Kong against each other with humanity caught in the balance. Honestly, I could care less about this Monsterverse. None of the movies have wowed me enough to think something great of them, and I just hated Godzilla: King of the Monsters. I must admit, the movie met my expectations and a little more. Once again, I'm not blown away by this, but I found myself entertained. One of the reasons that aided in the movie's favor is how self-aware it is. We saw the last time how subplots concerning humans can drag down a movie. All we want is the monster action at this point. This installment is more focused on the action (even how ridiculous it may be) and does its best to ignore the human subplots so we can have a much better time. The actor performances in here are probably the best out of the franchise so far so that's a definite plus. The only character that had enough depth to care about came from Jia played by Kaylee Hottle. She has a connection with Kong that brings some development to this monster.There's almost too much focus on Kong. All I cared about was him that when Godzilla came into the mix, I didn't feel like the battle was even. Godzilla felt like the antagonist more than anything. Maybe this is the point, but I couldn't see any argument why Godzilla should win when all positives went to Kong. The story becomes predictable in how the battles will result. For some fans there's a surprise that might enhance the story. Since I don't go out of my way to watch every single monster movie made, the surprise didn't effect me as much but it's something cool. The visual effects are the standout. They are absolutely great and so detailed that I kind of wished I saw this in theaters rather than on my small tv screen on HBOMAX. After all, everyone wanted a larger than life action movie so it's no wonder why it looks so great. I can't say much more about the movie. I'm not passionate enough towards the story to like the movie but I was genuinely entertained throughout. It seems this might be the movie to bring back movie theaters - sorry Tenet - so if you feel comfortable enough to return to theaters, this may be a good introduction back to the once normal experience.

GVK fixes one of the biggest complaints of KOTM, namely the fact that all the action is either shot at night or in rain.Once the action moves to Hong Kong the movie is essentially one giant action scene that is very entertaining. The story and performances are not particularly good though I liked Bryan Tyree Henry in this movie quite a bit, his was the only remotely interesting character and he gave the best performance IMHO. This movie is not great from a storytelling point of view but as a fun Kaiju battle movie it really delivers.I was not a fan of Godzilla 2014 at all but I feel like each new American Goji film since then have only improved as pieces of entertainment, while also making Godzilla's actual design better in each film. This time around Godzilla looks older,rugged, like he has really been through a lot and it is very effective. The CGI in this movie is nicely done and the monsters are quite emotive and move in a way that feels suitable to their size and character.All things considered definitely seek this one out if you are a Goji fan, a Kong fan, or if you just want to see an entertaining movie where two monsters kick butt."}, {"reviewer_name": "calsxperia", "date": "1 April 2021", "text": "Titles wrong,,,,, film ..boring ,,, I feel asleep...Feeling sleepy ....And I didn't miss anything..."}, {"reviewer_name": "bk-12866", "date": "28 March 2021", "text": "No one really cares about the human characters, except for Jia.

A few of the previous cast members from the first debacle, Godzilla: King of the Monsters (2019), reprise their awful one-note characters. Kyle Chandler and Millie Bobby Brown are back for more absurd encounters with this famous reptile and some very bad dialog to spew forth. This time around, our giant lizard focuses on battling one mighty big ape for the title crown of King of the Monsters instead of duking it out with the likes of Mothra, Ghidorah, and Rodan. It's a royal smackdown the sights of which you may never see again...or want to see again.As one character so astutely says. \"Godzilla's out there and he's hurting people, and we don't know why!\" (Doh, yeah we do...he's a monster!) This hybrid sequel bring the two titan beasts together with more of the same formula and stupidity that one normally expects in this sci-fi monster genre. Art, it ain't...nor does it strive to be. But is it too much to ask for some level of competency with a screenplay that is not so rote and inept, CGI that stays consistent with its epic proportions, and actors that bring some authenticity to their characters? The expression of the computer generated Kong and his details are uniformly strong; Godzilla, in more of a supporting role, is less successful in his movement and appearance. And the addition of a Transformer robotic monster for the climatic clash of the titans makes this outing just plain ludicrous. (I guess onesie beats twosie, but nothing beats three. And nothing on screen is remotely convincing or exciting either!) It's empty cinematic calorie counting. But it's not even campy enough to enjoy as a guilty pleasure.This sequel does have a new director at its helm, Adam Wingard, who is familiar with action and horror genres. To his credit, he does stage the combat scenes well and the action is, at least, visible and not lost in murky shadows as the previous film famously did. But there is a limit with what can be done with the generic screenplay by Eric Pearson and Max Borenstein. Seeing the cast scream their lines, regurgitate lengthy exposition, and holler orders does not exactly test their acting mettle. One desperately waits for the fight sequences to intrude on the dumb dialog and cardboard villainy. The plot remains confusing. Having the human props travel from Antarctica to Hong Kong at super speeds is never really explained. One can only assume it's a terrible plot device just to connect the fragmented storytelling which never gels its dual story-lines.Caught in this much ado about nothing are some fine actors who chose unwisely: Alexander Skarsg\u00e5rd, Demi\u00e1n Bichir, Elza Gonz\u00e1lez, Brian Tyree Henry, and Rebecca Hall, whose character certainly would not win any Mother of the Year awards as she continually places her deaf daughter (an overly cute Kaylee Hottle) in perilous situations. Let us hope their missteps in acting roles becomes a valuable lesson for all of these performers. Obviously, Ms. Brown and Mr. Chandler did not learn anything the first time around. Money is the real King of the Monsters.One can say that this second installment may be a tad better than the first updated version. But is that really a compliment? Bad is bad, no matter how you view it! And . Let's face it, Godzilla vs. Kong (2021), is bad. We can only hope this is the end for this franchise. But we know better, don't we?

And the monsters do not disappoint, I think almost all of us can agree on it.That's right, it's the fourth entry of WB/Legendary's MonsterVerse, a shared universe franchise I personally think has a good track run. Though many were divisive of the first Godzilla movie about how much screen time the big guy got but I was a huge fan of it; \"Kong: Skull Island\" was entertaining for me as well. When it comes to \"King of the Monsters\" though, I was not a fan of the human characters and it was somewhat saved by the amazing monster action. So what did I think of this movie overall? It was pretty good, I'll get into the problems too.So we'll cut to the chase: Yes, the movie delivers on its promise being a huge monster beatdown and it is GLORIOUS! I'm talking jaw-dropping action sequences with titanic blows and moves that made me giddy as a professional wrestling fan. They use planes, buildings, and a giant axe against each other, Kong uses buildings to swing away from Godzilla's fire breath, they went all out to make this the battle of the century. They outdo the original costumed 1962 rock 'em, sock 'em fight with great special effects and visuals. Though the reason the two of them fight is a vague theory of their ancestors being rivals, you can tell it's a fight to determine who is the top dog of the monsters and guess what? There actually is a winner. You'll have to see who wins.Unfortunately, you will probably have to endure the two problems of the movie: a predictable plot you can see once all the pieces are revealed and underwritten human characters which is something that is usually a big complaint in this franchise.The plot starts with Godzilla attacking a facility run by Apex Cybernetics unprovoked. A few people are questioning the reasons including Madison (played by Millie Bobby Brown from \"King of the Monsters\") and a conspiracy theorist Bernie (played by Brian Tyree Henry). It leads them breaking into the said facility to investigate the company run by a Bond villain-like businessman with a savior of humanity complex. Sure enough, they discover a mystery villain project which will undoubtedly lead to the third act. I'll keep it like that to avoid any spoilers.Kong is contained in a gigantic terrarium on Skull Island run by a scientist played by Rebecca Hall who adopted the last surviving native, a young, deaf girl named Jia (played by Kaylee Hottle). I found it pretty odd Kong formed a personal connection with a native of his island though they established he was a god to them and sort of minded his own business. Also I'd say Hall's character isn't really a good mom letting her daughter interact with Kong without some sort of protection.It's interesting how they divided the humans into sort a Team Kong and Team Godzilla dynamic which keeps you curious as to who to root for. I've seen some people say Godzilla was more of the villain, I personally disagree. Kong was definitely the more sympathetic of the two yet the franchise sets them up as characters who are a double edged sword.Anyways Apex sets up a plan to extract powerful energy from the Hollow Earth using Kong as a guide into the depths. And transporting him gets interrupted by Godzilla. Once you follow the movie, you pretty much know what is going to happen. It's a workable plot but again painfully predictable.The cast is good but unfortunately most of them are not written well. The human characters are not as stupid as they were in \"King of the Monsters\", I'll give them that; the humor did teeter on being Transformers level on annoying with the conspiracy theorist but they actually gave him a little dimension and I actually laughed at the jokes enough to be satisfied. They forgo character development to focus more on the monsters; I get there are a few movies that work without it and this movie kind of does but why not try and give us people to really invest in? Sure they were underdeveloped in the first Godzilla movie but at least I cared about them enough. I could barely give a fig if Godzilla stepped on most of the characters in \"King of the Monsters\". So I guess there were only two real human characters I found interesting: Jia the native girl and Bernie the conspiracy theorist though barely for the latter.Speaking of humans, this movie does not shy away from showing the carnage and that people actually die. It makes the third act from \"Man of Steel\" look like Kindergarten and it kind of makes sense because Godzilla and Kong are animals who aren't going to give regard for human life and destruction. My favorite shots are where the camera views the monster action from inside the buildings which give the impression you are a puny insect to these giants.Despite those two main problems, this movie succeeds in bringing two of cinema's most famous monsters in a grand showdown worthy of going back to the big screens and I highly recommend it as a matinee movie for most people. Just please be safe and healthy as always!My rating: 7/10."}, {"reviewer_name": "Sandra-durand80", "date": "5 April 2021", "text": "I thought it was a great and fun movie! A lot of action!

Many of the illogical moments come from Brian Tyree Henry, Millie Bobby Brown's Madison and Julian Dennison's Josh Valentine. On introduction to Henry's Bernie Hayes he blatantly echoes Jurassic Park's Dennis Nedry. Both Eiza Gonz\u00e1lez and Alexander Skarsg\u00e5rd are notable and are stellar actors but are lost in the special effects and mayhem. Rebecca Hall and Kaylee Hottle are good but feel borrowed in part from The MEG and Congo.In a bid to be world building Godzilla vs. Kong lacks the grounded feel of Kong Skull Island and Godzilla. Elements wouldn't look out of place in an Independence Day or Tron sequel.When the movie goes to the hollow earth, it takes an unexpected turn, while rich in new monsters, complete with a gravitational floating Kong, that coupled with an on the surface Mechanical Godzilla it's far removed from its predecessors. In amongst Kong actually becoming a king and both title monsters having a roar of showdown and more we actually have a moustache twirling bad guy.For fans, there's a moment with Kong on the ship that is reminiscent of Kong 1976 and many other nods to both franchises. Godzilla: King of Monsters fans may get more out of this outing but fans of Kong: Skull Island could find it harder to swallow thematically.Overall, its tonal seriousness doesn't fit well with its big budget, B-movie premise. It turns from science fiction to jarring sci-fi fantasy.

Finally, I thought, the moviemakers get it. We don't need 45 minutes of character padding. We came to see large monsters fight. The little girl was a great throwback to those 60s Godzilla films that threw in a strange child connection. But even better, the child is deaf. That meant less dialogue! Same goes with the setup of the monsters, having the previous films successfully done the job.As for the fight scenes, it really resembled a WWE smackdown. The Hong Kong fight had all the semblance of a professional wrestling fight, you were expecting a referee to be standing by. The 'villain' in this movie is some rich dude who makes Mecha-Godzilla. His introduction is short, and his presence is thankfully brief and gets to the point. Again, here we have the hybrid monster movie where it finally concedes that it is not very good at creating interesting characters and uses them only briefly to setup the next big monster scene.Perhaps that is the only complaint. Fight scenes can get a little repetitive. However, there were a couple scenes that showed some creativity in the setup, like visiting the fabled 'lost world' within the planet that is accessed through a hole in the top of the world. It was great fun seeing the filmmakers take these well known fantasy scenes and see them fully realised in high buck CGI. Another thing the moviemakers got right is the runtime. It was perhaps the most satisfying moment of my afternoon when the movie didn't overstay it's welcome and finished under two hours.I listened to a podcast recently reminding producers of summer blockbuster movies that we want to have fun. We don't want to get bogged down in morals or dragged out exposition or subplots. G vs K doesn't care about realism. We want what the entire reboot of the franchise was promising to deliver.

Being the fourth entry for Monsterverse, it is undeniably a pertinent continuation! With Gripping battles & Breathtaking CGI; this is precisely what a devoted fan wishes to see! Nevertheless, a bunch of forgettable characters and weaker script certainly influences the final outcome!\"If this wasn't contributing to world destruction, this would be a great DJ booth.\"Let me get this straight; if you consider yourself as one of those fervent followers of Monsterverse, Bravo! You have come to the right place. No matter what side you're on, the story prudently provides both Godzilla & Kong individual moments to shine! Therefore, appeasement for all tastes!The emphasis here is sincerely on the fights & the brawls, as they should be! Following a relatively dawdling start; upon the beginning of the second act, it gained traction and never looked back. Especially the last act, an impeccable show of Grandeur! 'Remarkable' would be an understatement!When visuals are concerned, It's beyond anything I imagined. One of the best CGI work to date. The way the Camera moves, the specific manner in which some shots were taken; suffice it to say Adam Wingard has nailed it on the presentation side. Accompanied with an exciting Score, composed by one of the best in this business; Junkie XL aka Thomas Holkenborg. Just as always, he succeeded in uplifting the whole mood!Setting aside all the technical proficiencies, the rest of it lacks severely in multiple aspects. For instance, The Script fails to convince us about the gravitas of the concurrent situation. A middling set of characters couldn't be of more help! Barring the sweet little kid 'Jia' ably played by debutante Kaylee Hottle, others added little to nothing value! Performances are not that bad, but what more could actors do if the source material on their hand is that much insufficient.Before concluding, I must admit that I had a great time. This is definitely being made prioritizing Fans' demands above all. An utterly serviceable venture that should impress a wider group of audiences.

Godzilla's face displays emotion for the first time, in a way which is not corrosive to the character. In \"reality\" this contest would end the moment Godzilla used his \"atomic breath\". The producers have come up with a decent if fanciful device to balance the odds.Intermediate scenes are tedious, and feature the same kind of low-octane humor and affable cast we've seen so many times (in Transformers, Pacific Rim, etc.)I wish I could give this a 6.5, but I can't give it a 7.

The way he constructed the fight scenes with clear showcase of the brawl and almost zero human intervention...was the best part of this installment.Kaiju or Giant monster films struggling with relatable human characters isn't a new thing but that doesn't mean it's something impossible to manage in this genre of films. Few Toho made Godzilla films even delivered in Heisei era. Even the very first in MonsterVerse, the 2014 Godzilla movie with Bryan Cranston's Joe Brody was a fine example but they stupidly killed him off very early in that film. This whole franchise could have move forward with that character alone exploring his struggle to live in a world full of Titans that killed his family, his suspicion & rebel against Govt & pvt. Agencies like Monarch & Apex which could have been a sensible arc for this films.But like the predecessors (mostly KOTM), GvK is also filled with too many characters, some of them were quite unnecessary including M Bobby Brown's Madison Russel, the Deadpool kid, Eiza Gonzalez as Maya Simmons & even Kyle Chandler as Mark Russel. B T Henry's pod caster character, Bernie Hayes could have been developed in a more interesting or serious way with someone like TJ Miller on that role instead.When you're making a film like this with a \"Vs\" in the title and particularly keeping the fan base in mind, I think GvK in that regard was quite self-aware film, it almost delivered exactly what the Kaiju fans were expecting...where the plot or much sense in it eventually becomes secondary in the process.As it's only the 2nd film for Kong in MonsterVerse, GvK turned out more of a Kong movie where Godzilla mostly appeared as a plot device or secondary character to some extent. But man...loved every second of those fight scenes. Glad finally able to see a MonterVerse movie (featuring Godzilla) with no blurry or dark screen.My only major complaint is they made MechaGodzilla excessively strong against Godzilla, the way Mecha G beating the hell out of Big G was terrible to watch as Godzilla failed to make any proper strike in response...which is kind of unusual as I can hardly recall any earlier Godzilla movie where this kind of thing happened with Godzilla in a singe fight continuously.

The cast of characters were fun and captivating, playing off of each other humorously and contributing great personalities to this fictional world. More importantly, the actual action of the film was second to none - great Guillermo del Toro beasts ravaged familiar cities and battled colossal mechanical titans in awesome fashion. It was unforgettable.For the first time in several years, I felt the same sense of wonder in a monster movie after seeing \"Godzilla vs. Kong\" in Imax. I paid well for the privilege.Kong and Zilla delivered in spades. This film is pure science fiction pornography, with far more mind-bending special effects than I had seen coming. Refreshingly, they didn't belabor the fantastical settings with explanations because I really didn't care - and you probably don't either. The battles of epic proportions to almost unfathomable scales are exhilarating, and, thankfully, make up a massive portion of the decent runtime. Just as I would start rolling my eyes at Millie Bobby Brown's angsty remarks, the camera would whip back to the action I really cared about.The weakness, as most of us expected, is the lazy wrap-around story marched dutifully forward by the humans. I didn't care for all but two of the characters (you will probably know which two). There are moments of comically bad writing and cringe-worthy deliveries, which just serve to give our race a role to play in the much grander world of the kaiju. This is fine. I didn't go to the movies because I care about what ridiculous plots the humans would come up with to stay somewhat relevant, and I sure as shoot don't care about how much bleach I need to stay off of Apex's radar. I barely know what Apex is and I just watched this film last night. Importantly, Warner Bros and Legendary Pictures learned from their last flick, which really disappointed. They took their foot off the \"dark and serious\" gas pedal (the same attitude that wrought the DC universe) and went for bewildering science fiction, good-natured and nightmarish in proportion.There are far better movies out there, but I knew what I was getting into.

The mighty ape takes a CGI tree and throws it at the sky, shattering the illusion: he's really in a virtual reality containment area. At least that explains why nothing looked real. As you have probably guessed, I'm not a big fan of movies that rely heavily on never-quite-perfect computer generated effects, however, I am a fan of bonkers movies, and once I had resigned myself to the inevitable glut of digital trickery, I actually had fun with this gloriously silly kaiju blockbuster.It's possible to pick holes in the preposterous plot until the cows come home: from the moment two kids are able to track down a technology industry whistle blower who doesn't even have the sense to disguise his voice for his podcast, the film shows a distinct disregard for common-sense. But for me, that is the film's greatest appeal-it doesn't give a damn how daft it all becomes, never letting logic or the laws of physics get in the way of entertainment. And entertaining it most certainly is...Mighty lizard Godzilla is provoked to attack the HQ of high tech corporation Apex Cybernetics, resulting in destruction on a major scale. The company's top dog Walter Simmons (Demi\u00e1n Bichir) convinces Hollow Earth theorist Nathan Lind (Alexander Skarsg\u00e5rd) to join a mission to the middle of the planet in the search for a power source with which they can defeat Godzilla; in order to succeed, they need Kong to lead the way, and so the ape is released. With Kong freed, Godzilla launches an attack to become the 'alpha titan'.After a mid-ocean smackdown that leaves Godzilla mistakenly believing that he has won, Kong finally makes it to the Antarctic, where a tunnel leads to the hollow centre of the Earth. Deaf child Jia (Kaylee Hottle), who is able to talk to Kong via sign language, tells the ape that the tunnel leads to where he might find his family; when Kong heads for home, Lind and a team of scientists follow in anti-gravity ships capable of withstanding the perilous journey (and which are clearly a cinch to learn how to operate).What follows is utterly ridiculous (unless you're a Hollow Earth believer), as the ships arrive in the centre of the planet, which is home to all manner of monsters; ridiculous, but also hugely enjoyable. I particularly liked the bat-parrots that inhabit Kong's throne room (although I'm not quite sure what a throne room, statues and carvings are doing there-perhaps these relics of a once great civilisation will be explained in a future film).Power source located and secured, the scientists return to the surface (going out being a lot easier than going in), Simmons using his newfound energy to fuel his ultimate creation: Mecha-Godzilla! Unfortunately, all control of the giant mechanical monster is soon lost: cue the destruction of Hong Kong as Mecha-Godzilla attacks Godzilla, with Kong putting his differences aside to help the lizard fight the robot. Budget well and truly blown!Minor niggles: Hottle's perpetual 'raised eyebrows' concerned expression, and the fact that the kaiju appear to move in slow motion (it's always bothered me in other massive monster moves, but was particularly noticeable here. I understand that it's to give the creatures a sense of mass, but I find their movement a little 'off'). Still, it's a solid 7/10 from me - totally bonkers blockbuster entertainment."}, {"reviewer_name": "justbadged", "date": "25 March 2021", "text": "Almost perfect; the animation, the sound and everything."}, {"reviewer_name": "chrishughes-93802", "date": "27 March 2021", "text": "About 20 mins of good action.

Endlessly shifted and chained up by the APEX organisation (or corporate human beings in other words), we feel desperately sorry for his plight - especially as he has a special relationship (via sign language) with little Jai. Jai is played by Kaylee Hottle, and in many ways is the star of the show. As cute as a button, she will break your heart. She really will.Spoilt Maia Simmons (Eiza Gonz\u00e1lez), daughter of rich baddie Walter (Demi\u00e1n Bichir) seems to be on an upward curve. Ruthless and stunningly beautiful, she often refers to Kong disparagingly as 'the monkey.' She really should know better. After being built up as a force to be reckoned with, it's supremely satisfying to see 'the monkey' end her life without even thinking about it, rendering her mission and her posturing entirely worthless.So then, when it becomes apparent that the much abused Kong is now a target for Godzilla, we're instantly on Kong's side; but Godzilla is supposed to be a (kind of) good buy as well, isn't he? Not here he isn't. He's mean and brutal and goes for Kong relentlessly - and all the big ape wants is 'home'.So when (I told you there'd be spoilers) Mechagodzilla turns up, created by APEX, naturally, from the DNA of previous Big Bad Ghidora, it's Godzilla's turn to get ragged. And he does. Mercilessly, relentlessly and repeatedly.Sitting in my cinema seat, a bottle of Coke Zero gone warm in my hands, I'm egging the machine creature on. Hit him, I'm thinking, and again - but the attack does not let up for a second. Godzilla is a spent force, a rag swung about in Mechagodzilla's metal claw - and still it doesn't stop. With Kong out of action, this promises to be a measured, horrifying end for the big lad. My allegiances change. This is a bit much, I'm thinking, this is cruelty to animals (forgetting that all this is CGI special effects)! So my sympathies at last drift towards the Big G, floundering and utterly humiliated, along with most of the surrounding architecture.Even I'm not going to give away the finale, but it as perfect as it could possibly be. Directed by Adam Wingard, who made a valiant attempt to breathe life into The Blair Witch franchise a few years ago, this is an absolute triumph, a stunning looking blockbuster in all senses of the word.Of these Legendary films, 'Godzilla' was good, let down by too many bland humans and not enough monsters, 'Godzilla King of the Monsters', was a vast improvement.

We got this in King of the Monsters and Skull Island, here we get it even more. Great. Oh, and it should be noted that the human characters in this particular installment are miles superior to what we got in the previous movies: there is a bunch of them, each with their own mindset, making it easier to find one of them intriguing. Alright, so far so good. Moving on to the technical stuff, the directing is a considerable improvement to King of the Monsters, not only in continuity but also in that it manages to convey the scale of the titans correctly, and consistently. The cinematography is on pair with the prequels. As for the visual effects, they are simply (even more) out of this world, further evolving the world of the monsterverse. Finally, the concept art was a step up from whatever came before it, with hundreds of creatures, environments and sci-fi ships blending together beautifully.And now it's time to discuss the remaining 5%. The plot has been building up all right to this point, exploring the beloved universe deeply, and providing us with a satisfying cinematic experience. Remember the 2014 movie? Well there's the Mutos, and there's Godzilla, and we learn they're enemies, and eventually they fight and Godzilla wins and that's all. The 2017 films however both feature a more intricate connection between the Kaijus, especially King of the Monsters, which showed Godzilla and Ghidorah's enmity directly in the wonderful Alaska standoff, then the Rodan and Mothra incidents that gave the titans some sort of personality, and finally the ending battle, the emotional background for which had long been worked on. And yet, Godzilla vs Kong thoughtlessly dives into the mistake of the first installment. Yes, the movie is NOT about Mechagodzilla, yes we do see the relationship between the two alphas evolve, and some great fights in-between, yet again the final battle ends up receiving too little exposition. Simply put, we get it that both Godzilla and Kong are the good guys, but what we don't get is why Mechagodzilla is the bad guy. Sure, some fancy tech terms depict it as a boosted Ghidorah that just took control of itself, but it's just not pictured as \"the ultimate destroyer\" that would require two eternal opponents to unite their forces in order to defeat. Same goes with the way he is defeated: instead of requiring the sacrifice of the glorious Queen of the Monsters and Serizawa in two emotionally-heavy sequences, Mechagodzilla is just split in half with an atomic-breath overcharged axe.Overall the film does correct errors of its predecessors, and was definitely an enjoyable viewing experience. It is a shame Dougherty in particular won't be getting the chance to write any sequels any time soon. We are talking a genre of its own here which has been a crucial part of cinema history for a long time."}, {"reviewer_name": "851222", "date": "29 June 2021", "text": "Greetings from Lithuania.\"Godzilla vs. Kong\" (2021) is a true summer movie - big, spectacular, well paced and entertaining.

Also its the kind of the story that you don't think about to much or analyze it while watching it. Acting was descent for the material.Overall, \"Godzilla vs. Kong\" is a spectacular mash up of these two legendary monsters. I liked the story that made this movie moving.

I didn't want to be there but still sat with a furrowed brow and watched respectfully, unlike a large portion of the packed full theatre. Stop clapping, cheering and clamouring during every moment of peace. You're allowed to enjoy the movie, but don't ruin it for everyone else.Nothing is surprising or interesting. The story goes exactly where you'd expect, the writing is as bad as you'd expect and the CGI is as amazing as you'd expect. The titans and one particular setting are stunning. My issues with the effects lie with the extreme overuse of them. When everything I'm looking at is noticeably CG I lose interest pretty quickly, it's just not entertaining to me. At times Kong looks a bit janky and from the side the boats look very bad but those aren't noticeable if you're not so detail oriented.Yes the CGI is great and the main focus of the movie is to have monsters maul, but why does it have to be so technically stale? Every single shot is a panning shot, left right up or down, there is zero variety in the shot composition or the kind of shot used. It doesn't help keep the film entertaining in the slightest and it became kind of disorienting. The sound design was mostly great but the mix is mostly awful, the music is way too overbearing in every scene and there is almost no compositional consistency to appreciate. I mention \"manipulative music\" a lot and I think this is the perfect example of it, the tone of the score changes at the flick of a switch just so that an average audience member has some kind of response to what's happening when the events of the film don't actually hold any significance.The writing is really stupid, the characters don't have any character and the B plot is so so terrible, it only exists so that three annoying side-characters can stumble upon multiple secrets that progress the plot without having to put too much time and effort into the $165 million dollar movie. I know that the main focus of the movie is titans tussling but at least put some effort in, which now that I think about it they might have done, when Adam Wingard working on your project it's hard to know.Throughout the course of 'Godzilla vs. Kong' nothing changes, all it is is a big 360\u00b0 anticlimax.

The long and short of it is, Godzilla vs. Kong is exactly what you think it is, but also not quite what the three preceding installments might have led you to hope for. Those films contained several unique, essential pieces of a great monster movie, but couldn't quite bring them all together in the same place. This effort may have scattered them to the ends of the Earth.While Godzilla '14 suffered from too much dusty orange, brown and grey, sacrificing spectacle for aura, that also gave it a unique air of mystery and a personal, street-level point of view. The big guy was a force of nature, neither good nor evil, often experienced as little more than a distant rumble through the clouds and clutter of so many toppled skyscrapers. Skull Island and King of the Monsters moved in pop-friendlier directions, granting a better view of the action, while also leaning on pure entertainment value and top-notch creative direction. This new model represents a continuation of that slide into crowd-pleasing razzle dazzle, delivering nearly two hours of curious neon lights, spit-flinging alpha roars, window-shattering concussions and flashy pin-up moments, but it's increasingly limited in most other respects.We get the fight, all right, and kudos for having the resolve to actually depict a winner after two rounds, but the big visuals aren't half as epic as the full-blown elemental fury seen in KotM, nor as ferociously intense as Kong's last solo flick. Both headliners move with a surprising lack of magnitude, swinging ten-story haymakers that land like stiff jabs, not earthquakes. We see so much casual collateral damage that forty-floor buildings become a mere inconvenience, minor hazards that spray black soot as they're toppled over. They might as well be made of cardboard, just like the old days.The nonsensical story elements fare no better. Not that this is a particular strength for previous chapters, or even for a vast majority of similar films. Godzilla vs. Kong is a bad example of storytelling amidst a genre that's renowned for bad storytelling. It's stuffed with cryptic lore, clich\u00e9d character archetypes, bone-headed decisions, mindless pseudo-science, telegraphed plot developments... a full bucket of hogwash that made me feel like a moron for paying attention. Kong's ancestral homeland is the worst such offense, a landscape so fundamentally stupid and conceptually flawed that I couldn't stop shaking my head, puzzling over its many gaping, mind-numbing inconsistencies. Godzilla is painted as villain right from the start, which takes all the fun out of picking sides and rooting for your favorite among friends.Listen, I'm not trying to be hard-to-please here. I don't need any sort of spiritual or philosophical revelation in the midst of my giant ape vs. Lizard skirmishes, but I also expect a little bit more respect than this.

Kong's harder because 1933's King Kong is an absolute classic and still holds up almost a century later. But I might call this the best Kong movie, as well.(Helps ALL of the King's sequels/remakes and appearances have been meh for the most part. EXCEPT Kong: Skull Island.)I'm totally rambling here - something I try to avoid doing in my reviews, but damnit...this was so incredible. Even at 2 hours with some definite downtime with clich\u00e9s, the time FLEW by and I had SO MUCH FUN. My biggest regret, however, was not seeing this for the first time in theatres. This SCREAMED IMAX and hopefully, with my second vaccination coming soon...I could fulfill that dream...I digress! As set up in the previous movies (2014's Godzilla, Kong: Skull Island and 2019's Godzilla: King of the Monsters,) Godzilla turns bad in the beginning. Or is he? Meanwhile, Kong's been monitored since the events of...Look. They meet, they mash, it's in the title. That's all anyone, including myself, cares about.And the fight between the two...BEST \"VS.\" MOVIE EVER! And this is coming from a fan of Freddy vs. Jason, Alien vs. Predator (yes, and Requiem, as well!) and even more controversially, Batman v Superman (but, mainly the Ultimate Edition.) This fight was so perfect, so colorful and everything preceding their battle leads you to believe their actions fit the two mammoth alpha predators.It was very nice they actually made Kong into an actual character and while hundreds of thousands of innocents die around him, you still root for him. And as for Godzilla, well, when he's on screen, he's badass. (And he's got some moves in him, as well.)You'll have to suspend your disbelief a ton, but remember: we're not just dealing with giant monsters, but one of them from the series is an alien. So, pretty much, anything goes here.I can't express how much fun I had here. There's even a surprise I hope no one ruins for you that really services both the fans of decade's past and ties the whole movie together. This isn't really a leave your brain at the door...but it is the definitive entertainment popcorn movie that accomplishes the goal the title promised.Recommendation?

The first Kong vs Godzilla movie we've had since 1962. The 1962 film is fun, cheesy schlock with effects that have certainly not aged well. You have actors in rubber suits fighting around miniature models of train tracks, buildings, army bases etc. It fun all around; best part for me is that I didn't have to read subtitled thanks to the English dub. And now we reach 2021, the best time to bring these behemoths to life, and pit them against one another.Like most people, I'm only watching Godzilla vs. Kong to see the two fight; the human characters and their storylines I just don't care about. Bryan Cranston's character was interesting, but they killed him off to make way for his way less interesting son in the 2014 movie. You have your stock 1 of 8 character arcs used for Vera Farmiga and Kyle Chandler in King of the Monsters. And now we have Godzilla vs. Kong with human characters you just don't care about.Alongside the Godzilla and Kong fights, and the stock human characters, this movie also introduces (SPOILERS) multiverses and the flat earth theory. No joke. It turns out that Kong comes from another dimension, and we journey there with him to gain a weapon he can use to defeat Kong. Now, neither Godzilla or Kong have ever been some of my favourite characters, but keeping the mystery of their origins would be better. All we need to know if that Kong is a giant gorilla from a prehistoric land, and Godzilla is a giant reptile birthed from nuclear radiation. That's all we need to know about them. We don't need some convoluted origin for either of them. Also as well, some of the technology in this movie seems a little too advanced in this, like we're living in the 23rd century. In Independence Day: Resurgence, we can buy that Earth tech has improved greatly because of all the alien tech that got left behind, but nothing explains why this type of tech would exist in this movie;One nitpick about giant monster movies I have is how it stays consistent with the size and weight these behemoths should have. Pacific Rim for example has great scenes where it emphasises the weight the Kaiju and Jaegers have. In the 2014 Godzilla, it mostly stays consistent with how slow Godzilla appears to us when he's moving. Godzilla and Kong at the end are fighting in normal speed like their normal size creatures. I get that if Kong and Godzilla were fighting in slow mo it'd get boring, but it'd be believable. You might as well just just have a human sized gorilla and Godzilla fight at that point. Another SPOILER for this movie: I won't reveal who the big villain who shows up at the end is, but let's say, this vs. Movie ends with Godzilla and Kong teaming up at the end to defeat it, and becoming 'friends'. It's Batman v Superman all over again.So the human characters suck and the convoluted parallel dimension storyline wasn't needed. I'd say skip it and wait for some YouTube video to come along combining all the fight scenes together. The fight scene on the ships is the best one in my opinion. Watch the fights scenes, or the scenes of Godzilla destroying cities, and nothing else. 5 out of 10."}, {"reviewer_name": "Foreverisacastironmess123", "date": "1 April 2021", "text": "The monster grappling was awesome but that's about all I enjoyed out of this if I'm honest, I was very disappointed how they weren't more kaijus or some new ones, I mean the giant bat snake things were cool but they were only there for a few minutes and were no nice surprise thanks to the trailer, this film had no surprises thanks to the latest foreign trailer, the only part that I was feeling a little awe from was when the Mechagodzilla finally went on the attack because, while looking like a Godzilla-Terminator, it was at least something different and kind of an additional Kaiju albeit an artificial one, and it was definitely very cool, I loved the way it moved and fighted with its atomic rocked powered fists!!!, it was totally wiping out Godzilla's colossal scaly ass until Kong stepped in! I liked when Godzilla did finally beat, wear down and physically submit Kong but stopped short of killing him as that isn't the kind of God that he is, as he only wanted to prove his superiority, although it was a very close fight, godzilla's breath gave him a big advantage, but when he stepped back and took his huge foot of Kong's chest and walked away that showed a little of the noble creature we'd previously seen and brought a little soul back to him instead of the roaring rampaging beast he acted like most of the time in this movie. I liked how Ghidora's skull came back and played into the story as it was integrated into the creation of Mechagodzilla through some very Pacific Rim-like technological mumbo-jumbo, but I wish they'd have established that a little of Ghidora's spirit and old hatred of Godzilla was somehow emerging through the machine's programming and was taking a little malevolent pleasure in ravaging the old foe that once annihilated the hell out of him, they should have had Kong discover more of his kind at some point too, that would have worked and been a happy ending for the great ape. So giant monster action good, human drama largely bad and boring as hell, I really thought it was sorely missing a greater variety of Kaiju and was to me severely lacking vital awe in the story, something King of the Monsters had plenty more of. Worth watching if you like this film series and it's signature monsters but in my opinion if it's intended as the finale it's a bit of a poor one and I greatly hope they make more because there's plenty more awesome beasts they could use. Great action scenes and not a bad movie but still to me kind of hollow somewhere, I wanted more. Messy, very, can't say I wasn't disappointed with it. Good not great..

It is the knock down drag out brawl that.... Really no one was clamoring for. Was there anyone out there that was really dying for this smash up to happen? I mean they made it and even if a train wreck it was bound to be entertaining as it crashed and burned. This follows along after the events of both 'Godzilla: King of Monsters' and 'Kong: Skull Island'. Kyle Chandler and Millie Bobby Brown reprise their roles on the Godzilla side of the house, but funnily no actors return from the Kong film. This film delivers basically exactly what you think it will. Some big CGI monsters beating on each other here and there. The film makers wanted Godzilla and Kong to battle, and they didn't care how they got there because they threw a lunatic plot together in order to pull off this mess. I will say I thought both the last Godzilla and Kong movies, despite good special effects, were below average outings due to horrible plots, bad scripts and poor characters. This film really is the child of those two parents so to expect more was probably setting the bar at an unattainable level.Kong is being monitored at containment facility on Skull Island by Rebecca Hall's Ilene Andrews and her deaf native adoptive daughter who, of course, has a rapport with the big monkey, and we discover they can even communicate through sign language which should've been a shock to no one. Godzilla reappears after its last outing and attacks a human research facility run by Apex Cybernetics. Apex and it's CEO played by Demian Bechir are straight out of the Bond super villain playbook. Because Godzilla attacked humans it is now labeled a rabid dog that must be put down. To fight Godzilla humanity needs a weapon and the idea is to use Kong and go to the center of the Earth where it is hollow and there is a biosphere and get a power source that can power a weapon that can destroy Godzilla. This sounds crazy to no one so it is full speed ahead with the stellar plan. Millie Bobby Brown and friends, played by Brian Tyree Henry and Julian Dennison, are sniffing out the true motivation and machinations of Apex and stumble onto quite a big secret. Despite the title an easy prediction to make is that Kong and Godzilla will fight, but will not kill each other at some point will team up to attack a larger threat. With their powers combined! Just like Captain Planet. In this case the larger threat comes in the form of Mechagodzilla which Apex built to be humanity's (read their) weaponized deterrence to these emerging titans that they cannot control. Suffice it to say that Apex loses control of their creation almost instantly and after what seems like a ridiculously brief engagement Godzilla and Kong tear Mechagodzilla apart.Whew! The characters here are slim and only exist to be able to give some narrative, any narrative, to the true purpose here which is to display Kong and Godzilla and the big bad Mechagodzilla. We don't care about any character or their stories. Why does Rebecca Hall have a deaf native girl as a sort of adopted daughter/Kong whisperer? They mention it, but we don't care. Did her and the Alexander Skarsgard character have a thing? We don't care. Where is Millie Bobby Brown's mom? We don't care although I suspect one disaster of a film was enough for Vera Farmiga hence mom is off somewhere ... busy.... Buying cigarettes or something. Ughhhh. The special effects here are good for the big titans themselves. Kong and Godzilla look good but their interaction with the natural world especially water looks bad or maybe not bad but just somehow wrong. Not natural. The fights are all that big titan slow motion stuff. The fights are entertaining enough, but but they didn't have a wow factor at all, and really there should've been more of them as that is all the production really cared about anyway. The final showdown should have definitely raged longer to make Mechagodzilla seem more formidable and the team up more powerful and dynamic.If you liked 'Godzilla: King of Monsters' and 'Kong: Skull Island' I think you have a good jumping off point to enjoy this. I would really like to see this movie with a more intelligent script and characters I care about rather than just whatever they apparently came up with in the first brainstorming session. The story is pretty horrendous as is the script and most of the characters, and we spent too much time on that which made me care less when we actually got to the large titans fighting. This is exactly how I expected this movie to go but it is still a Godzilla/Kong sized disappointment.Eric's Grade: D+"}, {"reviewer_name": "jewelch", "date": "6 April 2021", "text": "Godzilla vs. Kong is a thoroughly enjoyable, visually stunning action-packed piece of cinema filled with heartwarming moments.

It jumps from location to location. The plot motivations are irrational - mostly to set up the ridiculous giant monster battles we all came to see. Like the hey-let's-ship-Kong-on-top-of-a-boat garbage because you know Godzilla will never notice that! Then the let's-play-dead-thing because Godzilla will fall for that too. Only to fly Kong to Antarctica in a ginormous hammock because now Godzilla can't wait around or sense anything two hundred feet above the ocean surface!Just like the Toho originals, there is an innocent intermediary between the monster and the humans. This time it is little deaf girl who wins over the heart of Kong and teaches him sign language along the way. *eyeroll* Hold your lunch down for this part, folks; it's sickeningly sweet.The whole Jurassic Truman Hunger Show Games Park beginning was kinda decent but more of a necessity to setup the resulting Hollow Earth home stuff - which was a little too Avatar of the Rings with the floaty fire mountains and magic axe.

They knew that no matter HOW MUCH of a growth sprout Kong was going to get, he will NEVER truly beat Godzilla. It's just facts. I love Kong but Godzilla has already shown feats WAY beyond Kong ever did so it was obvious from the very beginning that Godzilla was going to win. However, I was still worried the writers were going to go the \"underdog pity\" route and find a way to have Kong win the fight, so he can become King Kong, but thankfully the writers knew better.As far as the fights go, however, it's still the best monster fights in the series. While Godzilla still wrecked Kong the most in this film, Kong was able to hold his own well enough. At the end of the day, though, Kong was the heart and soul of this movie. He may not be king yet, but he's a king in the making. For now, he is the Prince of the Monsters and the true heir to Godzilla's throne.MechaGodzilla is also in this movie and the way Godzilla and Kong team up to take it down was so awesome.The humans were still boring, as always, but the monster fights made up for it all.

This movie looks amazing. Not only the visual effects, but the cinematography and direction are top-notch and keep you hooked visually.Now, let's discuss the... the rest of this movie. Hoo boy.Look, I get it: this movie leans heavily into the \"fiction\" part of \"science-fiction\". But it's not only the fantasy technology that broke through my suspension of disbelief like a wrecking ball; it was the complete lack of effort they put into explaining ANY of it. And I mean ANY. Anti-gravity engines? OK! How? No idea! Telepathic uplink to a titan corpse? OK! How? No idea! (...and yes, if this is making you think of Pacific Rim, that's because this movie is basically Pacific Rim.) Point being, things just exist in this universe with no explanation, yet somehow all this hyper-futuristic tech is foiled by... a bit of liquid? ...OK!Not only is the tech complete nonsense; so is the entire human element of this movie, which is given so little attention, I wonder why there are actors in it at all. People magically teleport towards and away from danger without any rhyme or reason; a scientist can expertly pilot a futuristic military plane that he has literally never even seen before; Millie Bobby Brown is completely wasted; the villain is a villain, but why, exactly? What he says makes total sense. Seriously, the plot is completely incomprehensible.But the worst part has to be the crackpot conspiracy guy. He turns out to be... right. I mean, what? Have you seen the state of the world we live in, writers? What on earth made you think it would be compelling to vindicate the dude who believes in lizard people and mass population control through tap water? There was an obvious humorous twist to be made that it turns out he was wrong about everything and it was all a coincidence, but no. You decided to make the character who showers with bleach \"correct\". This is so mind-numbingly moronic, I can't even describe it.This movie looks great.

The journey he undertakes is not only fun to watch, but it's very relevant to the overall plot.It's not a perfect film by any means. But it also doesn't pretend to be.

As much as the plot is dumb and everything else, it serves its purpose to give you more enjoyable action scenes with moments of hardship, improvisation, motivation, and a human touch. Although bland, it's needed. If it was just crazy action the entire time then that same action would come off semi-boring and tiring. We gotta have some kind of set-up and build-up so that the fights are that much better, dynamic, and pace-boosting. Now, I do recommend this film if you can turn off your brain and have a fun time watching giant monsters beat the teeth out of each other. In that sense, this movie is a success but it's still a bad movie with no art in it, except for the designers and CGI-involved people who tried their hardest for this to look visually fun, arresting, and impressive.

Concentrating on Godzilla and King Kong battling made the two human stories weak, the weakest they've been in the whole franchise.On the Godzilla side is a direct sequel to King of Monsters with Millie Bobbi Brown and Kyle Chandler reprising their roles and on the Kong side is a new story featuring new characters.

But when the monsters are duking it out holy moly its so worth it. Its the saving grace of the film.

Godzilla vs. Kong delivers exactly what it promises: Truckloads of stylish and exhilarating creature action and in a short and sweet run. I don't understand why these big epics always need to be two-and-a-half hours long. You can get so much across in a small, tightly paced length. After all, it's just two enormous monsters duking it out, 113 minutes is more than enough for that.Despite the title, the film is more so Kong's story. Truthfully, I would've liked a little more Godzilla in there. Even if his scenes didn't amount to much it would've still evened the character balance a bit. What really makes up for that, though, is how clear as day the action is as opposed to its predecessors. There's no pitch darkness or intense weather obscuring the set-pieces this time around. We see the fights take place in mostly daylight or bright neon-lit areas, allowing us to appreciate every angle of the monsters, feel each blow they take and really soak in the chaos. It's a truly satisfying sight.As for the human characters: Yeah, they're mostly forgettable but I actually got a few decent laughs from them (namely Julian Dennison and Brian Tyree Henry) and I appreciate that they all took more initiative and discovered more about the creatures and where they came from than just observing and commenting on the destruction the whole time. I also think the crew nailed the believability with one character: A deaf girl who can communicate with Kong through sign language. It's by no means a complex connection but it had a touch of heart and it balanced the tone just right.Overall, despite their corny likability, the monster fights still have these human characters beat by lightyears and it's definitely worth sitting through their segments just to see the behemoths brawl and that's what we're all truly there for in the end. Godzilla vs. Kong is mighty fine popcorn entertainment. Fast, chaotic and fun for everyone. I really regret not seeing this on the big screen.

The premise was basically that Godzilla went nuts for no reason and the people need King to save them.And HOLY macaroni I had a blast with this movie. The movie stayed true to its name. Pretty much most of the movie was Godzilla battling out against Kong. I loved that the director was very aware of what the movie was about. He never tried to go for any complex themes or character development. Instead, he delivered beautiful and magnificent fight scenes for almost 2 hours.Godzilla and Kong looked so good. The editing and cinematography on these two giants were breathtaking and spectacular. The fight scenes were surprisingly creative and masterfully handled. There were creative camera shots that made audiences feel like they were in POV of Kong or Godzilla. Every fight scene, the director used different settings to his advantage.Here, the writer and the director made a great decision of giving minimal but adequate human characters that set the story into motion. We spent little time learning about the characters, and I think it was an excellent choice because no one cares about the characters in these types of movies. Nonetheless, characters played by Brian Tyree Henry and Julian Dennison provided some decent comedy. I'm actually not sure why Kyle Chandler was in this movie. He was just there for the big bucks I guess.A surprising aspect of the movie was that Kong was integral to the story. This was such a smart way to make sure that Kong had a lot of screen times and give audiences what they wanted. Also, the movie even gave some characters to Kong, as he was connected with a young girl. There were some sweet and wholesome moments.Lastly, I watched the movie on the big TV and had a great time. But this movie for sure belongs to the theater with IMAX and Dolby.Overall, a self-aware yet clever movie that delivered all the hypes and giants that the audiences expected and wanted.

This is the first time that an American movie features two of the greatest monster icons of all time battling it out to see who is going to be the alpha titan. This is also the first time in 59 years to feature both of them. This sequel is supposed to take place 5 years after Godzilla: King Of The Monsters and 51 years after Kong: Skull Island. This fun monster action movie is directed by Adam Wingard with a scale that is ridiculously epic.THINGS I LIKED:\nI loved the beginning of the movie. It showed a great sense of humor and a reminder of why we love King Kong so much. He looks as majestic and awesome as ever. I can't be the only one who thinks Kong is better than Godzilla, right? I know, I know...Godzilla can fight on land AND sea AND shoot lasers, but still...I wanted Kong to beat him up during the entire movie. This is NOT a spoiler! That simulated, digital habitat the humans created for him was cool and unexpected. It reminded me of the one they created in The Hunger Games.Incredible visual effects! We're sooo spoiled. The monsters look so sophisticated and detailed. If you can, try to see Godzilla vs. Kong in theaters on a big screen. I know...Covid. Just saying.You don't have to wait very long at all to see King Kong and Godzilla, at first separately, of course.There's a fun and humorous musical soundtrack by composer Junkie XL, who had actually written music for Godzilla just for fun because he's such a fan.When interviewed, Alexander Skarsgard explained that he was delighted to try a different kind of movie, especially after some of the dark films he has been in lately. He was also excited to work with director Adam Wingard, whom he described as \"smart, lovely, and incredible with actors.\"\nKaylee Hottle plays an adorable deaf girl in the movie who befriends King Kong and is able to communicate with him. Her family in real life is actually deaf. Her presence and story is super sweet and touching.The movie ends with a clear winner, something fans of both titans have never seen!Brian Tyree Henry and Julian Dennison provide most of the humor in the movie, which is necessary because the majority of the film is extremely serious and dramatic.Great sound effects. I got a kick out of watching the massive titans face-off by roaring in each other's faces.Rebecca Hall, Brian Tyree Henry, Eiza Gonzalez, Demian Bichir, Kyle Chandler, and Lance Reddick give solid performances.This is Shun Oguri's first English-speaking movie.Lots of new monsters to enjoy!Acts 2 & 3 really deliver for the fans.THINGS I DIDN'T LIKE:\nAs with all MonsterVerse movies, the human element lacks some oomph. The cast is huge, yet unnecessary. They're there to carry the story, but what fans want to see is two massive monsters duking it out. Mission accomplished.Cliched social commentary on corporate greed and power.You can't expect Boomers to make the right choices, can you? Of course not. Kids to the rescue.I really liked British actress Millie Bobby Brown in ENOLA HOLMES so I was excited to see her in this. In this movie, she's more of a feisty and intense teen with much less charm. Her American accent is impressive though!New Zealander Julian Dennison has had much bigger roles in other movies. He was really great in Hunt for the Wilderpeople and Deadpool 2. His storyline with Millie Bobby Brown was just unneeded and even distracting.There are quite a few storylines going on all at once.So much neon! Ha ha\nOther than provide eye candy, the beautiful Eiza Gonzalez doesn't really do much in the film.No end credit scenes.

Gojira vs. Kong represents an enthralling cinematic 'Gift' to long time Kaiju-film fans perfectly conceptualizing what we all waited to witness, wildly exceeding expectations in terms of fully realized smack-downs that are kinetically hyper-charged + aesthetically brilliant! Director Adam Wingard created the perfect Dai-kaiju super-match(s) here engendering Godzilla with the ferociously unrelenting fighting-Spirit we always anticipated while amazingly injecting Kong with majestic Charisma, and even a high-degree of 'relatability' thru his non-verbal interactions with 'Jia' (who definitely steals the show on the human end of things).I know some viewers will say this is still just a simplistic giant monster smash-up but it most definitely feels like Adam Wingard has given long-time kaiju fans a priceless gift miraculously breathing genuine 'Life' into both Titanic icons Godzilla/Gojira and King Kong, appearing (much more than ever before) realistic, naturalistic + terrifyingly charismatic earning them the right to Rule the Earth! (while hopefully peacefully co-existing with us puny humans in the meantime). Anyway, proclaiming 'Godzilla vs. Kong' a non-stop thrill ride all the way is a definite understatement! Hopefully, the immense success of G v K injects the cinematic 'Monster-verse' with enough juice to co-exist (alongside the 'Marvel-verse') for many decades more!

It takes a lot to steal a scene when your scene partner is a giant ape, but Kaylee did it. Thankfully, like the previous films, this one does not live or die with the humans that are in it. You are going to love this film on as big a screen as is available to you, where you can see the fight explode around you while the score shakes your seat. The bass is out of control good.

Every moment with them are spectacular and very fun to watch. The fight scenes are executed well and it's never a chore to see the monsters on the big screen.That being said, all the human stuff is a snooze fest and this film also suffers from the same issues that plagued the other films in the franchise. Particularly everything on the Godzilla end of the spectrum with Millie Bobby Brown, Julian Dennison, and Brian Tyree Henry. Henry plays a conspiracy theorist with a bit of paranoia and humor. I did feel like some of the humor from his character kinda fell flat and didn't work for the film overall. Also Kyle Chandler's role is more of a cameo which was disappointing for me cause he was the only human I connected with in GODZILLA: KING OF THE MONSTERS.However, while still not great I did feel like the human perspective on Kong's side to be slightly more well rounded with Alexander Skarsgard and Rebecca Hall leading the charge. It was cool to see Kong communicate with sign language and pair him up with a deaf girl named Jia, played by Kaylee Hottle.The reason to buy a ticket or get HBO Max is to see the titans fight, that is the draw and main event. Nobody is expecting a thought-provoking drama full of clever twists, but I think we can all acknowledge having human characters is a necessity.The Monsterverse films don't get a complete pass on this department. I know they tired with other films within the franchise, the first 2014 GODZILLA made the mistake of killing Bryan Cranston's character so early as he was the lynchpin of the film, then there was KONG: SKULL ISLAND and GODZILLA: KING OF THE MONSTERS which lacked substance. I bring this up because JAWS, the first JURASSIC PARK and even the first PACIFIC RIM are prime examples of accomplished monster/animal/creature films that make you engaged with the humans.I do appreciate that GODZILLA VS KONG dropped you right into the action with no slow burns or build ups like the previous installments(except for KONG: SKULL ISLAND which also dropped you into the action).

Going into this movie, the trailers kept reiterating that there can only be one alpha and one will fall. My hopes included King Kong winning. My prediction included King Kong losing.The movie's plot was terrible. It felt very rushed, and it lacked creativity in comparison to previous installments.The movie begins with Kong in containment on Skull Island; however, when Kong was last seen in Kong: Skull Island, her was free. Humans struggled to capture him in the movie's entirety but now at the beginning of this one he is in captivity and we are not shown how?Here Skull Island was stablished as a copy of Hollow Earth. Hollow Earth was described as the center of our world, but it is where all these Titans originate from, their home world. Humans wanted Kong to lead them there and their only way in was through Antarctica. Kong is taken there, and it was said that Kong could not survive in those conditions if he did not go towards Hollow Earth. If Skull Island is a mirror of Hollow Earth, why was the entrance not on Skull Island?Mega Godzilla was awesome to have; but it lacked thought. It is like the producers/directors/writers wanted Mega Godzilla in the story but became lazy with it. The one that made zero sense was when Mega Godzilla was about to kill Kong. Do they really expect me to believe that pouring alcohol on the computer is what disables human interference in shutting down Mega Godzilla? This just felt very lazy because prior it showed the characters attempting to override the system with passwords, hacking in, etc.Mega Godzilla should not have lost ability after the alcohol to the computer incident. For one, it showed that any human interaction was security locked out. This happened because the systems became compromised after the Monster Zero's remaining skull/brain took control of the machine. Essentially an alien artificial intelligence system took over Mega Godzilla. A pint of alcohol stopped it?I was really impressed with each of the Godzilla vs Kong fighting sequences. After all, that is one of the most anticipated parts I am excited for. It was jaw dropping to see Godzilla move with such surprising agility.

But still, knowing that if nothing else, then it would be a visual tour de force, then of course I sat down to watch this 2021 movie from director Adam Wingard.And yeah, \"Godzilla vs. Kong\" was exactly what I had believed it would be; and that being a movie that was fully devoid of a storyline that had just a grain of intellect behind it. And this movie is essentially a movie where you just disconnect your brain, lean back, grab the popcorn and just enjoy the visual effects. Sadly so, but I must applaud the CGI team behind \"Godzilla vs. Kong\", because they really worked their magic.The CGI in \"Godzilla vs. Kong\" were off the charts, just as expected of this movie. And the CGI team deliveres an in-your-face CGI galore here that is spectacular. I will go as far as saying that the movie is actually well worth watching for the special effects and CGI alone. I was completely blown away by the effects here, and the level of attention to detail was just grand.Just as with every other Godzilla movie in history, the human stories that they entwine into the battles between the Kaijus were insignificant, and I must say that the characters in this 2021 movie felt even more useless and pointless than ever before. I literally didn't care one bit for any of the characters, as they had the importance of paint on a wall, and had the same appeal. The characters felt like stand-ins milling about with no aim or purpose. And it was merely Kong and Godzilla that had any appeal in the movie. So names such as Alexander Skarsg\u00e5rd, Millie Bobby Brown, Kyle Chandler and so forth really had no moments to shine in this movie.\"Godzilla vs. Kong\" was a movie that was set up to be a major movie, but I felt somewhat cheated out of a grand experience here. Sure, \"Godzilla vs. Kong\" was watchable and enjoyable enough for the brainless Kaiju mayhem that it was, but I can't help but sit here now that the movie ended and thinking 'was that really it?'Again, moving back to the CGI team. I have to say that the final showdown between Godzilla and Kong, and then Godzilla and Kong against Mechagodzilla in Hong Kong was phenomenal. That scene alone more than made up for all the shortcomings that the movie was stacking in abundance. Having lived in Hong Kong, I must say that seeing this visual presentation of such destruction in that metropolis was just spectacular. Seriously, if for nothing else, then watch \"Godzilla vs. Kong\" for that scene alone.My 11 year old son and I watched \"Godzilla vs. Kong\" together and were mildly entertained. This wasn't a 'wow' experience in any way, aside from the CGI and special effects. A shame really, because Godzilla has been on a downward slope ever since migrating to American soil.My rating of the 2021 \"Godzilla vs. Kong\" lands on a six out of ten stars, and this is solely and without the shadow of a doubt because of the CGI and special effects and the fact that Kong and Godzilla got to duke it out."}, {"reviewer_name": "borismk-38942", "date": "31 March 2021", "text": "The Monsterverse films as a whole have generally been solid movies.

Then the human characters were pretty decent and at this point I wasn't looking for amazing character development or anything I just didn't want to be bored when I watched the human story and they delivered on that. The little girl who has a connection to Kong was good, I enjoyed seeing her relationship to Kong and their development that produced some good moments between the two. Alexander Skarsg\u00e5rd and Rebecca Hall were fine in this movie, they each had a story and they weren't bland and they delivered some funny lines too.Some characters though were pretty generic and bland for example Eiza Gonz\u00e1lez's character was generic and forgettable, Demi\u00e1n Bichir was very corny and cartoony and also Brian Tyree Henry who played a ratio host/conspiracy theorist had some funny lines at times but was often annoying and had some forced humor in the movie, him and Julian Dennison tried to be funny but at times came off as annoying. Kyle Chandler who played a more prominent role in the last Godzilla movie was just there is this one and lastly the story with Millie Bobby Brown slowed the movie down at times and her story felt too corny for this movie.The tone was also done well for the most part, when thing got serious especially with the fights you could feel the intensity and humor for the most part was handled well expect for some few moments that had forced humor but wasn't a major downside for the movie. Now let's talk about the action, when Kong and Godzilla fought it was epic the movie delivered exactly what I wanted from this movie, especially the last act of the movie was just non-stop action and it wasn't too much to the point you got bored. Without spoiling the last fight where Godzilla and Kong fought exceeded my expectations and the visuals and shots were well done and is undoubtedly the best action in the monster verse and they didn't cut away from the big monster fights like Godzilla (2014) did and there were a lot of epic moments. The visuals and CGI were great and well directed including some beautiful scenery and as I said it felt like an adventure movie at time and what's an adventure movie without some beautiful shots. I am glad Adam Wingard the director redeemed himself for that Death Note movie.Out of the two monsters Kong was the best in terms of narrative, he the better story of the two and connected to the human characters in a way that made sense and really felt something for Kong compared to Godzilla who I have felt little to nothing for in his past movies simplify because he has had the least human to monster connection in his last two movies and here he is a villain so that just made him more of a generic monster however that's all made up for when he fights cause it's amazing. Also without spoiling anything there is a surprise in this movie in the 3rd act that delivers some really nice action and moments too.Although this movie had some silly parts especially with scenes involving Brian Tyree Henry and Julian Dennison who tried too hard to be funny, some forgettable and generic characters, Godzilla not being able to connect or contribute to the story or character connections and the plot slowing down a bit at times, the main thing was that this movie was fun, exciting and delivered on the action especially the big fight between Godzilla vs Kong (and there is a definitive winner, so more points to this film) that exceeded my expectations, decent human characters and some a few surprises, this was a good movie, easily the best movie and well-rounded of the monster-verse."}, {"reviewer_name": "nakulagleofficial", "date": "28 March 2021", "text": "Just Watched this Film.

WB, finally gets two of its biggest franchises in the right direction then decides it's not making anymore????Well, as a huge Godzilla fan, watching the Godzilla marathons, was the highlight of my holidays. When the first WB Godzilla was released, I was so excited... then disappointed after the movie. Rinse repeat... the 2nd Godzilla movie.My question was how can they mess up these movies. Its far from rocket science. Giant Monsters, cool ones at that, fighting for the planet.So my hopes were super low for Godzilla Vs Kong.After watching the show, I was in bed in ahhh looking at the cool fight scenes. The back and forth action. The CGI was incredible... and all I kept thinking is FINALLY!!! Finally someone started listening to the fans.Godzilla and Kong was an action packed, poor story *as it should be, monster movie. They added enough new things to make up for the last movies and it was just a lot of fun.My only real negative is... there will not be another one.... Man... WB. Please get out of your own way. I hope they learn from the whole Zack Snyder JL cut, but knowing the arrogant Execs at Warner Bros., who think they know fans and don't.

The movie is named after the two Kaju but, they seem to be supporting characters. The movie Pacific Rim blends monsters and robots perfectly. The threats are more authentic, and the technological advancements are more obvious and necessary. Godzilla vs. Kong is so random and unexplained. How, is the question I continued to ask myself. Within this universe, so much goes unexplained. No one is aware of what Apex has accomplished? Where are the governing bodies or some established world organization to investigate these proceedings? What was Kong doing since the 70's? How did his island get destroyed again? How many times must we see the power hungry, reckless corporation story? Who is bringjng children on these kinds of excursions? Monarch has been supplanted by Apex? Why? Just so many plot holes. The CGI however, is fantastic.

Godzilla vs Kong also has a human element and once again, it isn't great, but it's so much less overbearing here and is really only used to Segway us from action set piece to action set piece and the action? My my... it's good. It's REALLY good! The fight scenes with Godzilla and Kong are some of the best Kaiju fight scenes out there. The effects are absolutely fantastic and the movements in the fights are fluent and easily followable. I'm going to move onto spoilers briefly here so, you have been warned. In the 3rd act of the movie we are introduced to the worst kept secret in recent movie history, Mechagodzilla and I don't even care that I knew he was going to be in it, because he's awesome! That final fight scene between the three of them? Scratch that, the whole sequence in Hong Kong is incredible. The crazy sci-fi, mind control, evil alien robot stuff is so Toho and I loved it.

It keeps you sitting on the edge of your seat. I really like the amazing graphics and the computer generated image effects.This movie is about two strong titans who won't back down from their throne. It happens that Godzilla's and Kong's ancestors were enemies centuries ago. While Kong is captive in a semi-artificial environment dome, Godzilla comes out of the ocean and walks in the city destroying everything that crosses his path. This is not the heroic Godzilla we watched from his last movie. No one understands why Godzilla is so angry. Ilene Andrews (Rebecca Hall), who takes care of Kong and Dr. Nathan Lind (Alexander Skarsgard) helps Kong find a safe place to live, which is the core of the Earth. While Kong is being transported on a huge ship, Godzilla senses Kong in the ocean. That's when the first extraordinary and intense battle of these two titans begins.This film has amazing CGI. Godzilla's rough skin and red eyes make it look like he is real. Kong looks like an actual gigantic ape. You can sense his soul in his eyes. He surprises the audience by having a special bond with an orphan named Jia (Kaylee Hottle), the only person able to communicate with him. The sound effects are amazing. The cast are all outstanding including a more mature Millie Bobby Brown who plays Madison Russell and a funny Julian Dennison who plays Maddie's friend Josh.The moral of this movie is that greed and excessive pride lead to an unnecessary rivalry situation. We need to leave the past in the past and start fresh. Unity is the key in this film.I give Godzilla vs. Kong 5 out of 5 stars and recommend it for ages 6 to 18m plus adults.

Interesting thing, Millie Bobby Brown's acting wasn't looking as professional as other and I love her, so maybe she wasn't best fit for this character.

The directors did a brilliant job with the visuals as well as the sound. Unlike previous monster based movies (specially Godzilla: King Of Monsters, Pacific Rim), where a lot of main fights are in the dark and you don't get to see or experience the thrill you expected, this one has a balance of both which made the movie very watchable. The story of Kong was very interesting and the CGI for the Kong, I believe, was a little better than Godzilla. Godzilla as usual, looked menacing, evil, badass, angry and boy! He looks EXACTLY the way he is supposed to look.Godzilla is a good guy and the role he plays against Kong is brilliant. Like not finishing him off in their every encounter even though he easily could have. Coincidentally, Kong's role is also great because he has never fought monsters his size (or bigger), he has no battle experience but still manages to put on a fight.Mechagodzilla was good too, literally almost killed OG Godzilla. I feel his part was rushed. They could have dragged his part more and it wouldn't feel like a drag for a badass like him. Easy 15-20 mins more of the last fight could have been better.Now to the human aspect, this was the most disappointing part of the whole movie:Millie and her counterparts play absolutely no worthy role in the whole movie. Just running around, sneaking past security as if the whole Apex facility is made from cardboard boxes and toy soldiers/security. They moving all the way to Hong Kong chilled about everything, horrible acting, not funny at all. Even her dad plays no role at all. And they magically meet at the end of the movie like c'mon.Team Kong seemed a lot mature than those amateurs. The little girl is the sweetest. Her smile made my heart burst with mirth. The adults around her played good roles too.All in all, great movie. Just what we multiverse fans wanted to see. Big monsters fighting all in. Very limited inputs of humans aspect.

Probably best seen on the big screen but my 65\" TV and sound bar was more than adequate to give it justice.Great cast, Beyond Excellent script, and Exceptional Special Effects and CGI. In fact I imagine it could earn a nod for those effects in the next Oscars.All nods to Peter Jackson's wonderful adaptation of Kong, but it won't top this movie. I'd be REALLY interested to know his thoughts on this movie.It's not just another Titan movie that bombards you with nothing but endless action scenes. This movie actually has you feeling for Titans and the people studying them equally. The last third is where it truly pours on the action.Can't say much more without spoilers but suffice to say it definitely delivers on the entertainment factor.

This is not the first time legendary monsters Godzilla and King Kong have fought each other, there was King Kong vs. Godzilla in 1962. Many were excited by this modern reboot, especially after the coronavirus pandemic delayed its release, directed by Adam Wingard (You're Next, The Guest, Blair Witch). Basically, five years since Godzilla defeated King Ghidorah, the Monarch corporation are monitoring Kong within a giant dome on Skull Island. Kong is visited by Jia (Kaylee Hottle), the last Iwi native and the adoptive daughter of Kong expert Ilene Andrews (Rebecca Hall), who is deaf and communicates with Kong via sign language. Apex Cybernetics employee Bernie Hayes (Brian Tyree Henry) is host of a Titan conspiracy theory podcast; he extracts data suggesting sinister activities at a Pensacola facility. However, Godzilla suddenly attacks the facility. Madison Russell (Millie Bobby Brown), who listens Bernie's podcast, enlists her friend Josh Valentine (Julian Dennison) to investigate Godzilla's sudden attacks. Apex CEO Walter Simmons (Demi\u00e1n Bichir) recruits former Monarch scientist Nathan Lind (Alexander Skarsg\u00e5rd), also a theorist on Hollow Earth, to guide a search for a power source into the Hollow Earth, the home world of the Titans. Nathan is initially hesitant as his brother died in a strong reverse-gravitational effect during an expedition to the Hollow Earth. Walter reveals that Apex has developed HEAVs (Hollow Earth Aerial Vehicles), specialized crafts that can withstand the pressure exerted by the gravity field, and he agrees to join the mission. Nathan meets with Ilene and convinces her to ask Kong to guide them through the Hollow Earth via an outpost in Antarctica. Nathan, Ilene, and an Apex team led by Walter's daughter Maia (Eiza Gonz\u00e1lez) board a modified barge escorted by the U. S. Navy that carries Kong, who is sedated and restrained. Godzilla attacks the convoy and fights with Kong but leaves after the ships disable their power and trick him into thinking they are destroyed. To avoid alerting Godzilla, Kong is airlifted to the entrance to Hollow Earth, and Jia convinces him to enter the tunnel while the team follows him in the HEAVs. Madison and Josh find Bernie, who joins their investigation. Sneaking into the wrecked Apex base, they discover a secret underground facility, and are inadvertently locked into an underground monorail transport to Apex headquarters in Hong Kong. There they unwittingly stumble on a test of Mechagodzilla, a large robotic machine that can be telepathically controlled through the neural networks from the skull of a severed Ghidorah head. The mechanical monster is to be controlled by Ren Serizawa (Shun Oguri), the son of the late Ishiro Serizawa, but is limp due to its power supply's limitations. Walter intends to harness the Hollow Earth's energy to increase Mechagodzilla's power. Kong and the team enter Hollow Earth where they find an ecosystem like Skull Island. They discover his species' ancestral throne room, with remains of an ancient war with Godzilla's kind and a glowing axe made from another Godzilla's dorsal plates. As they identify the power source, the code is sent to the Hong Kong Apex base despite Ilene's protests. Attracted by Mechagodzilla's activation, Godzilla arrives in Hong Kong, and sensing Kong, he directly drills a shaft to the throne room with his atomic breath. In the ensuing mayhem, Maia and the Apex team attempt to escape but Kong crushes their HEAV. Kong, Ilene, Jia, and Nathan ascend to Hong Kong, where Godzilla and Kong battle, destroying many skyscrapers in the process. Godzilla is initially overpowered by Kong, but Godzilla emerges victorious. Kong loses consciousness after being defeated by Godzilla. Madison, Josh, and Bernie are caught by security and taken to Walter. Despite Ren's concerns over the power source's volatility, Walter orders him to activate Mechagodzilla. Suddenly, Ghidorah's consciousness possesses Mechagodzilla, who kills Walter, electrocutes Ren and the starts to attack Hong Kong. Godzilla and Mechagodzilla battle, but Godzilla is overwhelmed. Nathan revives Kong by destroying the HEAV, causing a large jolt of electricity to stun him, and Jia convinces him to help Godzilla. As Mechagodzilla overpowers both Titans, Josh short-circuits Mechagodzilla's controls with Bernie's flask of liquor. Godzilla supercharges Kong's axe with his atomic breath, allowing Kong to destroy Mechagodzilla. Madison, Bernie, and Josh reunite with Mark Russell (Kyle Chandler), while Godzilla and Kong acknowledge each other before the two go their separate ways. Sometime later, Monarch has established an observation post in the Hollow Earth, where Kong now rules. Also starring Lance Reddick as Guillermin, Hakeem Kae-Kazim as Admiral Wilcox, and Ronny Chieng as Jay Wayne. The acting performances are fine, and the story is reasonable, but let's be honest, it's all about the title fight. It delivers exactly what you would expect, two giants of cinema brought together in a clash of the titans, and many large buildings destroyed, things blowing up and chaos all around, with fantastic special effects, it is better than I expected, a satisfactory and entertaining enough science-fiction monster movie.

Okay, I'm running out of positive things. On the negative part, I thought the plot was awful. The dialogue sucked and was laughable at times. There are a lot of cliches and tropes in this movie as well. Cliched social commentary on corporate greed and power. And as with all MonsterVerse movies, the human characters are poorly written. Most of them are either uninteresting, boring or altogether unnecessary. Julian Dennison, Brian Tyree Henry, and Millie Bobby Brown storyline was unneeded and distracting.

Adam wingard tried to focus as much as he could on kong and godzilla(and i admire him for the result), but if there were no humans, then neither would we have understood what was going on in the movie, neither would anything would have happened then.

The storyline for this is actually pretty good, simple and doesn't try too hard. I hate when these films try to work in a practical storyline into an impractical circumstance. This doesn't do that. The special effects and fight scenes are outstanding and well done. The film is also well paced - a lot of focus on the monsters, what's they're doing, where they're going and why. Not much else. That works well in this genre. No need to focus on family dynamics or anything involving feelings. Just get to monsters destroying things and each other - this hits that mark.

Really; everything you need is there.So why mess it all up?!I barely know where to start, but 90% of the problems are down to the shockingly bad script. The story is bafflingly stupid. Even for a movie trying to re-create the feel of the old 60's Godzilla movies, this was just stupid.For example. Kong lives on Skull Island. We've known that since the Kong: Skull Island film. It's his home; he's a giant gorilla who can't swim so he's not going anywhere. But for some reason Monarch built a giant holographic containment dome around him? And expects him NOT to know? Why? IT'S AN ISLAND! He can't leave, so what's the point of the damn dome? And what happened to the indigenous people there? They're all gone but one little girl who is deaf and taught Kong sign language without anyone knowing; what happened to them?So they decide that Kong can lead them to the hollow earth to find some magical energy source they think is there. And the only entrance is in Antarctica. Why? If the earth is hollow and we've seen Skull Crawlers come up from there in K:SI, why is the only entrance in Antartica?They're afraid to move Kong or Godzilla will know and come kill him. How would he know? Does Kong have an ankle monitor that alerts Godzilla if he leaves? And if Godzilla hates him that much that he'll kill him if he finds him, why not just go to Skull Island? He's Godzilla; he can easily reach the island and come onshore.Next they airlift Kong to Antarctica, where the kid convinces him to go down into the hollow earth so they can follow...because apparently he knows how to get there, but they can't follow a tunnel without him.In the meantime, a couple of kids (Madison from the last film, included surely for star power and nothing else) and a podcaster sneak into the base that Godzilla took out and get on a magical underground bullet train that sends stuff from Florida to Hong Kong. Underground. In like, warp speeds. Underground. UNDER. GROUND. From Florida to Hong Kong. What. The. Hell.The expedition team follow Kong in what are essentially space ships, because reasons. And the hollow earth looks a lot like regular earth. So...where's the sun? How do plants grow here? There's lots of light; where does it come from?So Kong heads to a mountain, and it has doors on it. No joke; giant doors. He opens the doors into a no-joke throne room. With statues of others of his kind, and an actual throne. Who made all this? Are we to believe Kong's species make furniture and doors now? Seriously?Godzilla finds out Kong is down there someway, and in one of the most ridiculous bits of the movie (in a movie already filled with ridiculous stuff) Godzilla uses his atomic breath to burn a hole from Hong Kong to the center of the earth. No kidding. And he does this in seconds.Kong uses the hole to to get back to the surface, where he fights Godzilla with his magic axe he picked up. In the meantime, the Apex folks who went on the mission send the energy signature to Apex headquarters (that's some kick-ass Wi-Fi right there) and Apex uses this to power up their Mecha-Godzilla. Don't even need the actual energy source; just the signature, which they can process into actual energy in about 20 seconds. No, I'm not joking, this actually happened.Kong and Godzilla beat on each other, and the fighting is good. But it's also a bit flaw in the film that makes me yearn for the 2014 one; the laws of physics appear not to apply here. Kong can jump on buildings, hang on them, climb on them, etc. He HAS to weight thousands of tons. Tens of thousands. So it takes you right out of the movie, because he shouldn't be able to climb buildings like that. It's ridiculous.Apex powers up their Mecha-Godzilla, which is controlled by - wait for it - the skull of Ghidora with a pilot. Somehow sticking wires into a skull makes it a living computer? Even though there's no brain left? Just the skull? But whatever. Bottom line, now that they have enough energy to power the mecha, it...snaps? Goes insane? Becomes controlled by Ghidora's skull? I don't know, because it's never said, but it comes alive on it's own and goes nuts and attacks Godzilla, and beats him up. Kong is convinced by the kid to help, and predictably he and Godzilla kill Mecha-Godzilla and part ways as monster friends.I think that's my problem. This didn't need to be so stupid. There was no need for the whole kid subplot. There was no need for the hollow earth story and magical energy source. All you needed was the basics; that Apex was building a Mecha-Godzilla using DNA from the Ghidora head from the last film and Godzilla didn't like it. Monarch brings Kong to stop Godzilla because they don't know this. Let them fight, let Mecha-Godzilla go nuts and attack because of faulty programming, and there you go. Tone down the stupid physics, and you'd have a better, smarter film. But for some reason, we have to have kids to save the day. We have to have an inane plotline with Kong having a throne room, because he's King Kong, after all, and we need to shove that down everyone's throat in case the audience is too stupid to know it.Could really have been good. I'd like to see a fan edit of that that cuts out the more ridiculous parts. Other than that, it's not worth a re-watch."}, {"reviewer_name": "tejasvichudasma", "date": "16 April 2021", "text": "The story is cross between kong, godzilla, pacific rim and batman vs superman.

It pits the two titular titans against each other in a by the numbers 'protagonist vs protagonist' story that has been done many times, most notably with 'Batman vs Superman' and 'Alien vs Predator'. This film follows 2019's 'Godzilla: King of the Monsters' but only brings back two of the characters, in a supporting role this time round, Kyle Chandler as 'Dr. Mark Russell' (in a heavily reduced role) and Millie Bobby Brown as 'Madison Russell'. We see the introduction of Brian Tyree Henry as 'Bernie Hayes' who is meant to act as the comic relief, however, most of the jokes fall flat.Nobody started watching this film expecting a brilliant, emotional and character driven story because none of them weren't evident in the previous outings in this franchise. Ever since the first trailer dropped, I only wanted to see this film for the epic fight between the two title characters and I'm glad to say they delivered on that promise. The CGI and effects in the big battles between the two are flawless, you can tell that the writers and director (Adam Wingard) knew why people are sitting down for 2 hours and watching this movie.The film does drag in between the two contests, as they try and build up the human characters, and give them something to do. As you could probably guess, this doesn't work, however the cinematography and the all round look of many of the shots are gorgeous. When Kong enters 'Hollow Earth' the vibrant colours used and the world created is beautiful.My main problems with 'Godzilla vs Kong' are the utilisation of the human characters. As I've said, they lack any development and are only there to drive the plot forward to the next CGI fight because the budget doesn't allow for 2 hours of Godzilla fighting Kong. They are incredibly generic, in particular, Demi\u00e1n Bichir's character, 'Walter Simmons' and his daughter, Eiza Gonz\u00e1lez's, 'Maya Simmons'. The characters only exist to add to the kill count in the third act by the hands of either Godzilla or Kong in what is meant to be a 'satisfying' kill but in truth nobody really feels anything about their death.Overall, I was left asking more questions about this movie because of the many plot holes that it rips open throughout. Personally, I wouldn't really care for a sequel, but as this film will more than likely make a profit, we'll probably get one.6.5/10."}, {"reviewer_name": "jlw-16876", "date": "4 April 2021", "text": "CGI is Amazing.All else sucks.The most unrealistic and unbelievable movie in a long time.

Thankfully the movie knows how to displace its action scenes, so you're never really bored, but just because we have Godzilla and Kong fighting doesn't give an excuse to give up on a compelling screenplay. Try as the actors may they cannot save the terrible dialogue and thinly slapped together story, in fact the only thing that can save the movie are the epic sequences from these two Kings of the Monsters.

There's actual daylight scenes/battles and the nighttime scenes aren't poorly lit like the first Godzilla in 2014. Hong Kong really brought the night life to the forefront as far as the vivid colors go. Matched with Godzilla's scales and atomic breath as well as Kong's battle axe. Pure cinematography glory. Speaking of the fight scenes, they're not abruptly cut every 5 seconds like KOTM was unfortunately. These battles are full on and do the monsters (Titans) justice unlike the Rodan vs Ghidora and the Mothra vs Rodan scenes. I wish they could almost go back and re shoot KOTM... to do it justice like they did with this movie. It's a tad shorter of a movie, but I can see why. They basically took out a lot of the human interaction and backstory and character development that people complained about in the other films. Which is perfect in my opinion, and how it should've been with the others. People wanna see monsters FIGHT! And that's exactly what they delivered with GvsK.

In this, even though neither die probably for the better, there is still a clear winner, Godzilla.

When Hollywood decides to pitch two characters, whether it's superheroes or monsters, that are essentially good against each other it usually turns into crap. Take the absolutely abysmal Batman vs Superman for instance. Then we have Kong Skull Island which, while still being watchable, had a really lousy script.But to my surprise I quite liked this movie. I really got worried when the movie started off with some nutcase activist that Hollywood likes to glorify. Then they had to kiss up to Communist News Network as well by giving them some product placement. Don't use a real world news network in fiction movies please. Especially not a well known fake news and far left propaganda machine.However, in the end it all turned out nicely. The nutcase activist was really a nutcase and really really annoying but he still turned out to be on the side of the good guys.The story was not altogether bad and although this story of the hollow earth is really far out fantasy more than anything else, even more than the idea of Kong and Godzilla themselves, I liked it. It was quite cool actually and it allowed for some nice special effects other than just Godzilla and Kong beating each other up and wrecking a few cities in the process.Speaking of special effects. They are really why you watch these kind of movies. Sure a half decent story and passable acting helps but the special effects are the bulk of the enjoyment. For me the movie didn't disappoint in this area.They were overall very good and actually quite balanced. Well balanced considering the kind of movie. You cannot have a Godzilla movie without at least a couple of city blocks getting demolished after all. Having an actual wet navy battleship showing up I do ascribe to the usual Hollywood writer stupidity of course but for the rest it was really cool. I especially liked the hollow earth scenes and the strange landscape with all the weird creatures.Warning, slight spoiler ahead: The thing I really liked with the movie was that the writers didn't go down the route of killing either Godzilla or Kong. Something I really feared and which would have reduced the movie to a rubbish rating as far as I am concerned. Instead they threw in Mechagodzilla which was quite cool albeit predictable at this point in the movie and one which united Godzilla and Kong. Also this weird, completely devoid of any (even fictional) science, link to Gidorah was quite a bit of a stretch.Overall, watching this movie was two hours well spent as far as I am concerned."}, {"reviewer_name": "lukem-52760", "date": "19 July 2021", "text": "Godzilla Vs.

An excellent cast.What i loved about this mega monster Blockbuster was the fact Kong is really the main lead character here & he's a huge loveable beast with feelings & emotions & is so likeable, they really put thought into this legendary & iconic movie monster.Also Godzilla has more put into his character as although a hugely dangerous & city destroying beast, he still thinks & has a heart as you see towards the end with the huge epic fight with Kong.The look of this film is beautiful with it's retro look of Neon lights & the visual of the old monster world of creatures & forests mixed with the futuristic New age with their flying vehicles & technology, its a great contrast of the old & ancient & the new & technical & it's striking on screen.The music is exciting & often retro 80's at times that really works for the film & look.I loved the Action, the cast, the cinematography & the c.g.i is Amazing!!!!There's so much exciting moments & Awesome scenes that it's truly an incredible Blockbuster movie but with a big heart.An Epic Big Monster Blockbuster that is so enjoyable & entertaining but also makes you think & care about the huge beasts that completely c.g.i creations!!!Epic Popcorn Blockbuster Entertainment."}, {"reviewer_name": "isaac-shaw", "date": "18 July 2021", "text": "Most people dream before sleeping and I am pretty sure most of them could come up with a better story in 20 minutes just before they fall asleep.It is an absolute challenge to feel for the characters.

I finally reach the end of my rope on reviews and this movie did it for me. I never thought I would ever reach this point or if a movie would actually stir this feeling of conspiracy in me but here it goes. Kong represents the human race or anything with a vertebrate while Godzilla represents Reptilians which have long been a conspiracy for as long as the time itself has been seeing them from \"Lord Shiva in India was a Reptilians being\", In Mayan Cultures, Inca Cultures and all over the world even in Germany American soldiers that were captured sworn they saw Reptilians commanders, but then again they were influenced by hunger and drugs. The point of the matter is that it has long been recorded that there has been some kind of humanoid existence of reptilians beings and Godzilla represents those beings. I am sure off my rocker on this review going off on explanations of creatures I myself have never encounter but it seems this movie seems to be a message to all of us that we are to be friends with them and not enemies and that Technology is our enemy and that together we will fight against an evil A. I. Man I am on a Terminator role today because this movie was rocking and rolling with terminator Godzilla! All that it was missing was TI 2000 Mega Godzilla showing up from the future to join the battle and kill Kong. Maybe the next movie lol the Mega Godzilla returns from the future to kill baby kong? Just kidding. That is so terrible for me to say and the kids would be like crying. Oh common it is just a movie! I am just throwing some comedy into the mix since I am already in the crazy zone I might as well go full nutso.

The oversized ape is probably the closest thing the piece has to a protagonist, as its battles are all told from his perspective and the human characters all just sort of blend into two sides of the same coin. Picking up after the events of 'Godzilla: King of The Monsters (2019)', the picture focuses on a group of scientists who want to find a mysterious power source located in a strange 'hollow earth' that resides inside the planet's core and decide that they need a tour guide - a giant, hairy tour guide. That's where Kong comes in, as he's carted off to the entrance to this strange land and asked to follow his natural instincts inside. At the same time, Godzilla has seemingly turned against humanity when he begins to attack Apex facilities. An obsessed podcaster and one of the two characters to return from the Monsterverse's last outing think that there may be more to this, though, and engage in a bit of old-fashioned corporate espionage. These two plot threads exist almost in isolation with one another for the majority of the picture's run-time. In fact, the latter just feels plain unnecessary in the moment, distracting from what seems to be the main focus of the narrative. In the end, the two strands weave together fairly nicely in a finale that puts everyone more or less in the same location, but - even in retrospect -it all still feels a little inelegant. As does the narrative in general, to be honest. It's almost paper-thin, perpetuated by flat characters and jargon-filled pseudo-science, and clearly only exists as a way to get these two titans to duke it out. Of course, most people don't come to this kind of thing expecting to see top-tier character development or theme-driven storytelling. It's just that these things are sorely missed, even if only subconsciously, because all the large-scale punch-ups in the world can't make you care about a film filled with boring characters and a half-baked story. Still, the action is rather enjoyable. It's brought to life with brilliant visual effects and is choreographed so that you can actually see what's going on (the days of the Monsterverse hiding its monsters are, thankfully, over). Though the original 'Godzilla' and 'Kong' films may hold a special place in your heart, you can't deny that these big boys have never looked better. When they're punching and clawing and scraping and roaring, the picture is definitely at its best. It's entertaining and does exactly what it needs to do. That's why, overall, the film just about stumbles into 'decent' territory. There are elements of its human drama that work quite well, but for the most part it's still lacking - as it has been for the past three films - and some of the the affair's writing is straight-up terrible (one line literally made me audibly wince). Yet, its building-toppling brawls are fair bit of fun and are visual treats, to boot. It's not a great experience, but it's good enough for what it is. At least we can see what's going on this time, too. 6/10."}, {"reviewer_name": "alfiofalsaperna", "date": "8 July 2021", "text": "Great action and fantastic fights by Godzilla and Kong, a really good movie."}, {"reviewer_name": "ThomasDrufke", "date": "6 July 2021", "text": "The films in this new monster universe haven't impressed me much at all thus far, but the action does seem to be consistently entertaining.

It stays faithful to the original for the most part but the plot gets rather convoluted in the middle section as it diverts into a subterranean world that gets a little confusing but the battle scenes between the two titans are what we're here to see and that doesn't disappoint as they wreak havoc and destruction in their wake.If as much care had been taken over the script as with the CGI effects and more charismatic actors were cast in the leads this would have been a much more satisfying experience as it doesn't really add up to much when all is said and done but it does what it says on the tin so don't expect too much."}, {"reviewer_name": "CurseOfTheRaven", "date": "29 June 2021", "text": "So, this film started out really great then it rapidly went down hill...I'll give my reasoning...\nToo much of a clich\u00e9 where there are kids saving the adults whilst two huge monsters fight each other and destroy a city or two.Not to mention the bad lighting throughout the entire film and the size of both Godzilla & Kong, they go from small enough to be on a ship, then all of a sudden in Hong Kong they are the heights of the skyscrapers, I found it confusing.Then the other sizing issue was with the Hollow Earth, is it just me or did Hollow Earth seem bigger than the actual Earth?The story itself didn't fully go into reason for Godzilla attacking the cities in the first place, I know the sound frequency was meant to be the reason but when the next attack Godzilla committed was against Kong on the ships, the ships weren't emitting the frequency of a Titan.Also, how can Godzilla's radiation beam be so strong to go to the Hollow Earth yet not strong enough to destroy the Mecha Godzilla?Another confusing thing was the fact that 1 adult and 2 teenagers managed to break into a high tech facility and then go to the basement, baring in mind this is a facility that has created the Mecha Godzilla, then they sneak on a hyper train that takes them to Hong Kong, they only get caught because the adult was standing?Then the kid tries to guess the password to a satellite and then just pours alcohol on it and glitches Mecha Godzilla? C'mon now that's just terrible writing.This film looking at it from faraway seems watchable, then when you do watch it you can spot the flaws instantly, also why is this film so short?

And while I waited a little too long and was spoiled a little before going to finally see it, Godzilla vs. Kong (2021) delivered on its promise to show me two large animals fighting.The trouble with the MonsterVerse franchise is that ultimately, the humans surrounding these titans are insignificant. Sure, they may drive some plot here and there, but mostly they're present for exposition as to why these giants are even fighting in the first place. In previous entries, I usually let it slide. However, I found the addition of conspiracy theorist Bernie Hayes (Brian Tyree Henry) to be a bit too obnoxious for my tastes and almost wished they had just left Madison Russell (Millie Bobby Brown) to do her own thing; regardless of these \"conspiracies.\"Aside from the human element, how do the fights stack up? While they are certainly visually stunning, they mostly felt too short. Considering the movie is about these two beasts facing off, I was surprised the fights weren't a more significant part of the runtime. However, I did appreciate the introduction of a third character (that will remain nameless to prevent spoiling it for you), if for no other reason than I liked to see the modern take on this classic monster.

The CGI was great and improved than the Godzilla (2014). More visualised and colourful effects made on CGI made it a worthy watchable. The action scenes were awesome and stylish which are the only saving grace in the film. The character arks are still decent and this movie give us characters we might care.The plot is just average and not well balanced on the writing part. The worst part were the human dramas in the movie. More unwanted scenes on the human drama part which made that parts of movie like a boring melodrama. In the end, they had a good and simple story here, to justify the action, and then they kept adding extra human stuff and made this movie really annoyingBoth Godzilla and Kong have very good amount of screen time in fights each other. The aircraft fight scenes and hollow earth fight scenes are amazing. Whenever the monsters are fighting each other,it made more interesting to watch the well-designed action. However,the climax battle was good but could've added more action in it. The villain also completely scores another part of the movie. There's something so mindlessly satisfying in seeing giant monsters beating the hell out of each other while leaving heavy destruction in their wake. However,Godzilla seemed more like a huge guest appearance in the movie. As per a big monsteverse content,the director could've get a deep script with added plenty of action scenes and maded it atleast a more than 2hr movie.Still, Godzilla:king of monsters and Kong:skull island are the best of the two monster's movies ever and this movie only comes between them.As far as monsterverse movies go,\n\"Godzilla vs. Kong\" does a serviceable job at entertaining us with frequent action and great special effects.

Nothing in this Monsterverse suggest the idea of Giant Robots. Apex Robotics is the worst type of telegraphed bad cooperate entity. Alex Skarsgard character is the biggest bore, and with out a doubt the worst character. Ilene Andrews and Kaylee Hottle are a highlight the best human characters they are loveable, and the relationship believable. The Millie Bobby Brown and her side plot is somewhat irritating.

Kong recovers from their battle with help from his human allies and helps Godzilla defeat Mecha-Godzilla. I love the Monster battles, and visuals. The Human story line wasn't anything all that interesting but that's why this film is so great. It's a film about monsters this time not humans. It's got some flaws but all in all it's a great film."}, {"reviewer_name": "movieman6-413-929510", "date": "16 June 2021", "text": "Godzilla vs Kong is the latest movie in the Monsterverse film series. The film is directed by Adam Wingard, the director of The Guest and You're Next.In the film, the Monarch organization investigates a location in the Earth's core. They need King Kong's help in this investigation. When they take him out of his environment for their research, they upset the balance in the world. They have to deal with Godzilla, who sees Kong as a threat. This leads to a battle between the two titans, where humanity can do no more than watch.Adam Wingard knows how to convey this film together with the story of the writers. He makes for an entertaining film about a fight between the two classic monsters. The human characters, while some are a bit unnecessary, serve as tools to deliver the story. While they try to give most of the characters that function, most of the entertainment continues to come from the gigantic monsters in the movie. King Kong, in particular, gets more to do in the film compared to Gozilla.The effects in the movie also look good. Sometimes the CGI can be seen with which the monsters are placed in the film. Then when the monsters take care of the entertaining battles, you forget to pay more attention to the small details and just enjoy the amusing monster battles. Adam Wingard also conveys the size of the monsters in the film in a believable way in such a way that you can actually see them thinking about their best actions in their fights. He also knows how to give the monsters some emotion in the film. This helps you as a viewer to stand behind certain monsters a bit more, so that you can almost choose together with others which monster you support.The acting is done in an appropriate way by the film cast. Young Kaylee Hottle steals the film with her role as deaf orphan girl Jia. Kaylee is really deaf in real life like her entire family. It's special how at her young age she can only communicate with sign language and act against a CGI monkey, who isn't even really in the film. Brian Tyree Henry, as a conspiracy theory activist, also provides some comedic moments in the film. The rest of the film cast then plays more of the accompanying roles, with which the story and the monsters can continue. Too many actors have been cast. If some of the characters weren't in the movie, it wouldn't have changed the movie much."}, {"reviewer_name": "msbreviews", "date": "15 June 2021", "text": "If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog to read my full review :)\"Godzilla vs. Kong is the return to form from the divisive MonsterVerse. Max Borenstein and Eric Pearson manage to write an uncomplicated screenplay without absurd plot points or extremely dumb character decisions, which is all I ever asked for in this franchise, even if it carries tons of formulas and cliches. No one expects an Oscar-worthy script, but something that can serve as a companion piece to the massive battles between the Titans. Adam Wingard struggles to balance the unnecessary, irrelevant side stories that unfortunately affect the film's pacing and tone, but ultimately he's able to set up each fighting sequence nicely. Action-wise, it's the best entry of the saga, by far. From the genuinely impressive, eyegasmic CGI work to the exciting, adrenaline-pumping monster fights that will leave you at the edge of your seat, this movie is the definition of pure blockbuster entertainment.

I did not feel like I was seeing anything that hadn't already been done from a kaiju-esque combat scene, but the computer generated monsters were beautiful and I'm sure someone worked very hard on animating Kong and Godzilla.The Bad:Milly Bobby Brown, Julian Dennison, and nearly all of the human characters were left with nothing to really do to embrace their acting chops, with a shout out to Demian Bichir, who I felt pulled off the bad-guy pretty well.

The humans were a bit bland but not plain unlikable as in the sequels (short of Skull Island).The monster fighting is fun but the movie still feels one monster sequence short that could have been added or extended over the painful human characters who just quip or cry. The young girl added is fine enough if not shoe horned in and deaf literally just so Kong has a way to communicate.It was all very predictable but still enjoyable to witness and it has some beautiful shots and cinematography, but it doesn't make the most out of the amazing new landscapes and again doesn't really have a sense of scale.Mechagodzilla was simply awesome, silly and a joy to watch. The circumstances around it's creation are dumb and stereotypically and comically villainous but in fairness you can't really create Mechagodzilla without it being self aware and goofy.Just cut out the boring and unfunny humans rather than adding more each movie. You need tension between the fights and to build an atmosphere but there must be better ways of doing that over Milly Bobby Brown wondering for 2 hours or Kyle Chandler doing nothing.So to summarise it was my third favourite of the monsterverse behind Godzilla 2014 which I think was the best directed and Kong which had the best story and characters, which I guess makes it my second worst but I prefer to think of it as third best."}, {"reviewer_name": "johndobson", "date": "2 April 2021", "text": "This movie was a bit of a mess.They were always going to need to advance the plot quickly, and should have added fewer characters and developed those they did add well.

Nobody is expecting theater from a Godzilla vs. Kong movie. Even by those standards, however, there are too many moments where it just gets too difficult to suspend disbelief. The spectacle of the behemoths duking it out is not enough to compensate for what is supposed to be a plot, utterly throwaway characters, uninspired dialogue, and complete lack of continuity (the physical size and scale of both Godzilla and Kong is inconsistent; They are bigger or smaller depending on the backdrop of each scene).The film looks good aesthetically and is probably excellent in a theatre setting, but really it's just....loud.

The monster fights are truly the best part of the movie, and the movie seems to know this; which is why the pacing is pretty fast, and it gets you to what you came to see. However, that's where this movie's good qualities abruptly stop.Due to its said pacing, it feels rushed and under developed. And speaking of development, the characters have their goals in mind, but very unclear character development towards said goals. Even Kong himself seems to suffer from this. And aside from all of that, it's never explained why Godzilla is seemingly \"intentionally harming humans\" in his attempts to fight Mechagodzilla.I mean, sure, Godzilla has killed other people, but in this universe, it's not normally and exactly intentional. Godzilla in the Monsterverse is potrayed as a benevolent creature who fights to protect creatures who can't easily defend themselves (whether it be a less significant creature or humanity; much like Kong, as suggested in Skull Island. So the fact that Godzilla is now \"intentionally\" harming humans without any clear explanation, other than Mechagodzilla's/King Ghidorah's presence provoked him, is really unsatisfing. But aside from all of that, I don't see much purpose in giving Kong his atomic axe, since it's too overpowered. It's kinda cheating in how it can repel Godzilla's atomic breath.Anyway, the only place where this movie succeeds is its action. If that's what you came to see (which is mostly and probably the case), then you won't be disappointed. However, if you come to see character development and mind boggling questions, then you'll be gravely disappointed.

KONG is one of the most entertaining films of the year thus far, and demands to be watched on the biggest screen with the best sound possible. It gives fans of the franchise everything they could possibly want and more with bombastic and ridiculously destructive sequences that often outdo the previous films. I had a smile on my face during every fight sequence, and those fights take up much of the film's runtime.One of the main criticisms of this film is that the human characters are far less interesting than the titans, and while this is correct, I don't think it held the movie back from being consistently engaging and fun. My main criticism is that one particular storyline had no reason to be in the movie whatsoever and never connects itself to the rest of the plot, but it was still entertaining to watch so I can't complain too much. The fight sequences are so well-filmed and even gorgeous at times that it's almost impossible to fathom how they captured the footage. The sound design and visual effects couldn't be better, making for a visual and auditory experience like no other.At the end of the day, GODZILLA VS.

My biggest complaint is the way the fights were handled. In every single scene the two fought, Godzilla beat Kong. In the first fight, he would have drowned Kong to death, and in the other fight Godzilla practically killed Kong. The most annoying part was that obviously they're not going to have either die (how else would they set up a milkable franchise like this with one of them dead?) but every fight Kong had to rely on the humans for help. Like I said, Kong would have drowned to death without them dropping charges to the bottom of the ocean to break Kong free, and Kong never stood a chance without them taking him to the Hollow Earth in order to retrieve his weapon, and would have basically died had it not been for the humans shocking his heart.This was an exciting movie and very fun.

Massive destruction and the most epic monsters of the last century finally meet in this century. You must be able to tell my excitement or utter boredom to watch a movie released on a Wednesday; yet, here we are talking about Godzilla vs. Kong. It's the historic next chapter of two icons meeting to balance the Earth's scales while also destroying most things humanity has built. Let's see if it was worth the wait.First, there is way too much talking in this movie. We all know what we came to see! Godzilla! Run, run, run! Oh no, it's King Kong! Save the woman he holds in his hands! Yet, the filmmakers again found it necessary to just talk talk talk talk talk talk. You have gigantic CGI Monsters to entertain us! Quit with the scenes of Eleven or the cute deaf child and mom and give us the epic fights we deserve. No actor in this movie is bad, but they also aren't memorable in the slightest. The only thing I remember is that they are holding us back from - just like I'm holding this review back to talk about nonsense - the major event Kong vs. Godzilla.The two heroes are one word... impressive. The scenery - impressive. It feels a bit \"borrowed\" from Avatar but impressive nonetheless. I mean there's the total and absolute destruction of Toyko. I didn't realize the city was that large but who cares. I mean probably hundreds of thousands of people died in these battles but who's keeping track. I know the filmmakers aren't. They went full on DC Movies with the destruction in this one. Yes, it makes for an entertaining movie, except we could've stood even more battle scenes and less watch Kong run scenes. This movie was more like a King Kong therapy session rather than a battle for Earth at times. Also, I wish they featured Godzilla a bit more. Yes, we've seen his movies to sleep, but he is a star of the movie... treat him like one.Long story short, you know what you're coming for. Don't get brand new out here and I might not even suggest risking your life in the theaters.

Simple yes, but it actually works for the monsters. Its human subplot that just doesn't work. They all seem out of place, I wish Godzilla killed all of them in the first scenes.Still, the actions is great and almost non-stop, it takes a large portion of the movie. Sure the ending is as predictable as it can be which is obviously open for a sequel.All things said, its worth watching for the fights alone.

The photography has very positive moments especially in the action scenes, which is different from some films of giant creatures that in action scenes it is not possible to see ANYTHING (cof cof Transformers cof). But the sound effects of some scenes are very questionable decisions by the director or whoever it was, most of the film has a good editing and sound mixing, but there are some moments that leave something to be desired, but it definitely did not affect my experience.I had a bad feeling when I found out that the director of Blair Witch (2016) and Death Note (2017) would be the director of Godzilla vs Kong, but what I watched was something much better than the last two, the film already starts without shame to show one of his monsters, besides that in this scene it is visible how much the trailers exposed the story of the film too much, crucial points that would be much more exciting if we found out while watching the movie.The core of Madison's character (Millie Bobby Brown) is only for two things, I will not give spoilers but only the second thing is important, apart from that, they are irrelevant to the plot, in fact I must comment that when the plot stops following the Kong's center line for this nucleus the film loses a lot of the strength it was creating. The characters are even charismatic with their interpreters, but nothing more, since the script decides not to develop them, although with Bernie's character (Brian Tyree Henry) they try to give him a sad backstory to try to create a compassion with the public that even works but the feature film preferred to leave the corner and move on with the plot.Kong's core, as already mentioned, is much more interesting, since when they left the skull island until the final fight, although that part of the plot could have a better character development but I created compassion for them nonetheless.There is something that bothered me a lot in the 1st Act, and the word is Elipse. Elipse is something very valid to make the plot more dynamic, but there are some moments that I felt like watching an extended version of the film (which I even hope to be released) because it seemed that the characters simply teleported to another place without showing what happened in that half time between scenes, thankfully it only happens in the 1st act because from the 2nd onwards things get better.I only wrote negative points about the film, but now something I liked that was the art direction of the film, from the visuals of the titans to the Hollow Earth that are exceptional, if the entire film was set within the dictation whose I wouldn't mind. I should even add that a film entirely made within Terra Hollow in the future of Monsterverse would not be bad.Another thing I liked was the artifice of the script to make things happen, but it depends a lot on your suspension of discretion, for me it worked.In resume: We have a very fun and exciting film with good fucking scenes with good special effects, but in terms of script and characters they could be a little bit better. And if someone asked me if this is the best Monsterverse movie I would say No.Note 6,4 / 10,0."}, {"reviewer_name": "blanston-25010", "date": "1 April 2021", "text": "If you like giant monster fights, I think you'll be pleased by 'Godzilla vs. Kong'. After 'Godzilla: King of the Monsters' took that weird turn with Vera Farmiga's completely unsympathetic character who I guess we were supposed to feel sympathy for, I didn't have high hopes for the human protagonists, or general plot of 'Godzilla vs. Kong', but they actually made them NOT complete psychopaths and gave them an interesting adventure to go on with King Kong, using the famous \"hollow earth\" myth as a vehicle, so I was pleasantly surprised by that.There IS a villain, but his plan and reasoning actually did make some sense, unlike those of the 'King of the Monsters' villain(s), and his hammy performance was much appreciated.All of this is in the service of eventually getting us to the spectacle of King Kong fighting Godzilla (and another favorite monster I won't spoil), but I do kind of require at least the bare minimum of a plot and comprehensible characters, and in that respect this one fares much better than 'King of the Monsters'. In fact, I'd say this the best of the giant monster reboot films so far. The fight itself is worth it, and if we're going by who took the most defeats, I think there actually WAS a winner, but I won't spoil which Titan won the title.This is the first movie I've seen in theaters in over a year, and it was a lot of fun. The theater I was at didn't have a 3D showing, and there are some visual sequences that would probably be pretty cool in 3D, so see it that way if you can.Also, Godzilla tries to answer the age-old question of five year olds everywhere, which is; If I dig a hole deep enough, can I dig my way to China?

However, being a Godzilla fan I still had to check it out. Every criticism made for Godzilla: KOTM (an uneven but MUCH more enjoyable movie) applies in Godzilla vs Kong, but multiplied. The plot makes NO sense and you have to just roll with it. Characters are annoying and underdeveloped. The acting is either stiff (Skarsg\u00e5rd, Gonzalez), weak (Millie) or downright embarassing (B. T. Henry). The kid actor was far from stellar but that's the adults' fault for casting/directing.Dialogue was unbelievable and had the worst traits of the weaker entries in the MCU.All of this would be somewhat forgiven if the action was satisfying. Frankly, it was mostly a disappointment. You need to pace & stage your scenes accordingly to create tension and drama. No such craft was displayed here. People complained about Godzilla 2014 and how slow it felt. While I agree the teasing in that movie became too much, at least it truly paid respect to Godzilla; you felt the scale, the blows and the stakes. Same with the VERY entertaining and violent Kong: Skull Island. Even KOTM, for all its shortcomings, at least had a very menacing Ghidorah, a charismatic Mothra and the despicable & unpredictable Rodan.Godzilla was a non-entity here. Completely devoid of personality, screentime & lacking in presence. This is Kong's movie first and foremost. The thing is, Kong sucks here. He spends most of his time imprisoned; being manipulated by humans; being nice to a little girl and jobbing to Godzilla.The movie WILL try to deceive you by having a subpar third act with some VERY cool moments: The Hong Kong Battle is pretty neat and MechaGodzilla's design felt refreshing and cool. The predictable team-up was also enjoyable. Nonetheless, to get to THAT point in the movie, you have to suffer through everything else.I truly do not understand critics. By far the worst movie in the MonsterVerse yet the one that will be seen as the highlight of it. My best advice is: skip to the third act and you'll make a good use of your time.

That's VERY confusing....2014 was perfectly directed as it maintained the real world feel with monsters in it. Could've been a lighter in some scenes,sure but everything else was solid if they had just included more fighting and the same holds true for Godzilla vs kong....it was literally a couple short fight scenes then a long drawn out story until the the last 30 minutes.

Too many cut away from fights, focus on humans instead of the monsters leading the story etc. However, Godzilla vs Kong, fixes a great deal of these issues and delivers us one of the best monsterverse movies to date.The CGI is truly breathtaking, watch it in 2160p if possible. The action is choreographed really well and for once the cut away is not as annoying. Little interactions between Kong and Godzilla and great and monsters actually show emotion really well, hats off to the cinematography and CGI team.This is is what classic Kaiju fans wanted and for human connection we finally have a character who doesn't annoy us, GIA / JIA is fantastic as Kong's human sidekick and has a lot of emotional value for those looking for it. Rest of the cast are simply cogwheels to get the monsters going and giving them motivation, some might not enjoy that but I for one think thats how monster movies should be done.

The first fight sequence especially was really freaking awesome. All fight scenes totally defied all laws of physics- just as they should. It also demonstrated improper emergency defibrillator use but I'll let that slide just because Kong punched Godzilla in the face and used aircraft carriers as skipping stones. I would actually give the movie a 7 and the monster fight scenes a 9 so I averaged it out to 8."}, {"reviewer_name": "adammartin-71590", "date": "1 April 2021", "text": "Just watched it, and really enjoyed it. Yes, the story and character were silly, but much better than King Of The Monsters and Skull Island. I couldnt get into KOFM, too much camera looking at titans fights then annoyingly pans to the humans doing pointless things before the battle really begins. This one didn't do that. Fight scenes is definitely worth the admission ticket alone. Turn your brain off and enjoy this epic blockbuster. Many 'Vs' movies are letdown except of Freddy Vs Jason, this movie is the best of it. Trailer does show too much of this movie, there's plenty yet to seen. I watched it on 100\" projector at home and I can imagine myself being very disappointed if i watched it on normal tv.

On one hand the Godzilla vs Kong battles are top notch, the CGI, the sounds, everything is really well made. However, there are just so many weird things going on with the human side of this story. It sort of feels like they tried to pull in every cliche trope possible from the over the top conspiracy guy, his rag tag teenage duo, to then the blandest villains imaginable. Also, felt like the dad character was so insignificant I wonder why there were so many very thin story arcs going on that were rather unnecessary.

She actually does something in this film and her character is a major upgrade from KOTM. The new characters are a mixed bag though, Bernie and millie's classmate serve as the typical comic relief characters and do a pretty good job at it. One major upside to the movie is that there aren't too many side characters like in KOTM.

This movie begs for the big screen. The massive scale of the entire thing just seems so much less impressive sitting on the couch.As usually, the puny humans don't add anything.

I am genuinely curious how many people perished during Godzilla and King Kong's grudge match in the city - I suppose it was probably a wise choice from a writing perspective to not explore that question in too much detail. But seriously, if you're not aware of the real-life things going on in Hong Kong right now - courtesy of the Chinese government - do some research about it, it's heartbreaking and important to be aware of. Now, moving on from international politics...Godzilla vs. Kong has been in the makings since 2014's Godzilla first hit theaters, establishing what's become known as the \"MonsterVerse.\" I found the franchise's inaugural film fun, entertaining, and surprising in the way it put audiences in the shoes of its human characters. That film's sequels - Kong: Skull Island and Godzilla: King of the Monsters - were both underwhelming, featuring thinly written and uninteresting characters and sporting more boredom than the CGI-fueled spectacle could make up for. So, I was cautiously optimistic as I continued hearing news of the long-awaited Godzilla vs. Kong showdown, but that caution turned to excitement when the first trailer dropped a couple of months ago. It looked like the franchise was headed in the right direction, ditching the attempts at complicated world-building and half-assed character development in favor of narrowing its focus to the titular Titans. I'm happy to proclaim that the MonsterVerse has once again found its stride with this new entry by embracing what makes the franchise work and delivering a wildly enjoyable movie experience.Godzilla vs. Kong stars an A-list cast that includes Alexander Skarsg\u00e5rd, Rebecca Hall, Millie Bobby Brown, Brian Tyree Henry, and Kyle Chandler, among other familiar faces. However, like the film that they're a part of, I won't spend much time discussing their characters. Each of the actors do a fine job with the roles they're given: disposable, live-action embodiments of stereotypes from decades of monster movies. Their presence simply drives the plot and delivers exposition that can't be ascertained from the grumblings & roars of the movie's titular beasts. I found myself caring slightly about the trio of characters following Kong around throughout the runtime, but that was about it.Thankfully, the movie doesn't try to be a character study about the people following the action. Its sole focuses are Godzilla, King Kong, and the millennia-old conflict existing between their species. And my, oh my, how glorious that conflict is. The Titans are brought to life in the film by some excellent CGI work, resulting in movie scenes that wouldn't have been feasible only a few years ago. The setup that builds to their fights is surprisingly interesting and not completely devoid of logic. Some of the finer details presented during these scenes are cause for question (i.e., the physics of the \"planet\" existing below the Earth's surface, the reasoning behind events occurring in one city instead of another, the logic behind the villainous Apex organization's evil plan), but those details are never so ridiculous to the point of ceasing the enjoyment of the film. The setup is surprisingly well-paced too - at 113 minutes including credits, Godzilla vs. Kong is not obnoxiously or unreasonably long, and it never lags in its storytelling to the point where I was bored.From this point on, I'll be getting into the ins-and-outs of the movie's bombastic fight scenes, which will be touching upon spoiler territory. So here is a SPOILER WARNING if you have not seen the film yet - skip to the last paragraph for the concise wrap-up of my thoughts.I was happy to see that Godzilla vs. Kong didn't go down the route that the trailer led us to believe. Instead of Godzilla destroying cities and killing people without provocation with the possibility that he was being controlled by some devious human, his destruction (which was isolated to a single incident early in the film) was entirely of his own accord and was conducted with the intent to target the work of Apex Cybernetics - back to that in a minute. Godzilla's grudge against King Kong is revealed to be simply that: a grudge. As established in Godzilla: King of the Monsters, the giant lizard likes to be the apex predator on his planet. Kong happens to be the only remaining Titan threatening his dominance, making their fight a straightforward personal affair. I enjoyed the decision to write the film this way, as it was far less clich\u00e9d or annoying as other routes the story could have gone.Once we finally get to see Godzilla and Kong fight for the first time in the Tasman Sea, it's straight-up awesome. We quickly learn their strengths and weaknesses: for example, Godzilla excels in water and with ranged attacks, Kong has the upper hand in close quarters combat and generally fights smarter. I questioned the ability of an aircraft carrier to handle the combined weight of the monsters, but it was easy to forget about that once they got back to throwing fists at each other and knocking each other about in the water. This initial fight - along with the following sequence where Kong leads a group of scientists into the \"Hollow Earth,\" as it is referred to - shows a surprising amount of success in making Kong feel like a being with emotion and feelings. It gives the movie a bit more of a soul beyond the human characters, which I applaud the writing and CGI-work for.Godzilla vs. Kong blew me away in its final act, which takes place (as I mentioned) in Hong Kong. This confrontation between the Titans - which is much longer than their first engagement - is an absolute blast and every bit as fun as the trailers led me to believe. Every blow delivered by Kong's fist or Godzilla's claws, every building smashed to millions of pieces, and every deafening roar makes for an absolutely epic showdown. After Godzilla nearly kills Kong, Apex is revealed to be completing development of a Mechagodzilla, an entity that many fans predicted would appear as an antagonist. First, I quite enjoyed the \"side trio\" of characters and their quest to discover the organization's intentions. While I was able to discern what they were doing early in the film thanks to the internet's musings, it was still an entertaining and visually popping mystery that gave a few of the side characters something compelling to do. Second, the design and inclusion of the entity is absolutely badass. Its presence serves a similar purpose to Doomsday's in Batman v. Superman: Dawn of Justice: it gives the titular figures a reason to fight together. The final three-way clash between Godzilla, King Kong, and Mechagodzilla is every bit as astonishing as it sounds, concluding the film in resounding fashion.Godzilla vs. Kong was everything I expected and just about everything I wanted. The film slacks in ways that aren't surprising, primarily in its depiction of the human characters and bits of nonsense that makes its way into the plot. However, I'm able to forgive much of that in the wake of the adrenaline-filled spectacle that dominates the film's runtime. If you're going out of your way to watch two monsters fight each other and have a hell-of-a-good-time in the process, you will NOT be disappointed. Godzilla vs. Kong was the most fun I've had watching a movie in a long time, and I am quite happy that I made the decision to go see it in a theater rather than watch it on my couch in my apartment. If you have any interest in seeing the film, I highly recommend taking the time and money to go see it at your local theater, both because theater chains are struggling right now in the midst of the pandemic and because this is a movie that begs to be seen on a big screen. I thoroughly enjoyed Godzilla vs. Kong, and I'm giving it 8 out of 10 stars."}, {"reviewer_name": "santiago-28931", "date": "1 April 2021", "text": "I went in with low expectations.

No more and no less.Of course, there is no story, cause you can't really do a coherent story in such a film, especially in 2021.Even more, focusing too much on human characters would've just made this worse and boring. We've been through that. So this time, they reduced the story part of the film and just focused on more monster fight scenes.Since this is a big-budget Hollywood blockbuster and a pseudo-Transformers (Pacific Rim, whatever) monster movie you know everything that is going to happen in the film from the first 15 minutes. There are no surprises, the characters are just cliches, and you can see some serious producers committee work behind this, cause they heavily recycle casting choices, scenes, and some approaches from different films. Like they have Baxter stockman character from Bay's Turtles, Spiderman school friend as comic relief, and more. Kong performed the Thor from the Infinity War maneuver. They try to add in some awkward humor, and it probably works for younger kids, but I found this to be completely unfunny.The film is bright and colorful, they explain everything that is happening through expository dialogue, besides a couple of slow scenes in the beginning the film tries to act fast not to lose attention. I think this was made for younger audiences, but I'm not sure that these audiences know or care about Godzilla, but I'm not sure.While some fight scenes are ok and the CGI overall has enough quality and work put into it, I still can't say I enjoyed this film a lot, it wasn't boring most of the time, but I just think that this clearly wasn't made for me.You might enjoy this if you love absolutely brainless action blockbusters, or you consider yourself a fan of the creatures and what to see them in a visually pleasant production (they deliver).Other than that there is really nothing to praise here.

Guess what! That is exactly what this movie did. I thought the FX were awesome and the action was spot on. Best of all it was genuinely FUN!The type of fun that when a kid watches it with his friends, or dad it can spark his imagination and love for sci-fi monsters for years to come.Hopefully they make many more of these movies in the future.

The whole thing was entertaining but kinda broke down toward the end.Some people have mentioned Transformers style fights. But I thought they kinda copied the structure of Transformers too. Two groups of humans. One with soldiers, the other a group of 3 with techie and comic relief.Some nitpicks that kinda took me out of it:Music choices in a couple of early scenes didn't seem to make sense.Fighter pilots can launch missiles from 100 miles away but fly within arms reach of giant monsters.Kong/Godzilla rivalry?Hollow Earth structure left a ton of questions about how it was built and by who, who built that axe and how, if it was that hard to get down there how did they get out etc\nGodzilla could breath blast through 2000 miles of the Earth's layers?Is Hong Kong really all neon? I guess it really doesn't matter since the whole skyline was wiped out in the fight.How did Skarsgard know how to pilot the Matrix\nNebuchadnezzar hovercraft?The \"bad guy\" and his daughter were wiped out in seconds without any satisfying payoff for their characters.The Kong movie was way better than the Godzilla movie.

Most of the time, I can invest myself into the movies even if it's slow- but this just hurt me a lot to sit through.

While it delivers on the intense battle between the two gigantic Titans, the movie is filled with inconsistencies, unsympathetic human characters, and a meandering story that lacked monster action for a good portion of runtime. I didn't find myself caring for anybody despite the talents of Brown, Skarsgard, Henry, Dennison, Hall, and Gonzales. The filmmakers tried to incorporate humor but it only landed half the time, the other 50% of the jokes felt out of place or just plain awkward. This wouldn't be as much of an issue if audiences were mostly focusing on the monsters however we follow the humans for most of Godzilla vs Kong!!! However when we do get to the action, rarely ever does the camera cut away. The shots of the fights are brilliantly captured similar to the previous movies in the Monsterverse but the movie is hampered down by numerous plot holes, boring characters and their arcs, and lack of action for the first act/half of the film. Here's hoping the Monsterverse can continue so we can get more films with these characters and more fully fleshed out humans."}, {"reviewer_name": "Jdurre02", "date": "31 March 2021", "text": "If you enjoy watching giant monsters beating each other up and trashing cities, this is the movie for you.

This movie, does what most 'Kaiju' movies usually do. The human element usually takes up 'x' amount of time while most of us await the duel between the titans. Unlike many others monster films, it's tolerable in this one. The overall plot isn't that complex, but it's just captivating enough to keep you motivated until the duel unfolds.The CGI, score, and overall sound design is top notch, especially if you have the opportunity to watch it in theaters, which I can't recommend enough (wear your mask!)Is this the best movie ever? No. But if you enjoy 'Kaiju' movies like I do, you'll enjoy this one.Is it better than Shin Godzilla?

The way Kong lost wasn't all that great either. He got a few scratches then had a foot on his chest after losing on the boat. He was babied and the fact that the trailers kept saying \"we need Kong the world needs him\" Added more salt to the wound. I was alright that Kong got beaten but do it in a good fashion.

Unfortunately we got a sorry tech billionaire power grab scheme that obviously didn't go the way he thought it would.The lack of story telling and character building is pretty nonexistent overall especially if you consider Monarch having been a major fixture in the other films, was sadly reduced to a relief organization in this film.Overall I'll have to say that I was pretty disappointed with it, but I'm sure your milage might vary."}, {"reviewer_name": "jjustinovalencio", "date": "31 March 2021", "text": "As a natural fan of the King Kong and Godzilla films, I fell in love when I knew there was going to be a confrontation, back in 2017.

The film is not perfect (as basically all existing films) my only big problems with this film are the humans, as in Monsterverse tradition, humans are very \"meh\", there is no development, most of the time they just talk about things or obvious or unnecessary, but otherwise just a few fan \"bores\" that if I were to put it here I would have to mark it as \"spoiler\".

Adam Wingard's direction is amazing, the music is awesome, the action is great, the visuals are stunning, the human plot isn't actually as bad as reviews make it out to be, and it's an overall great movie...But I don't like what this movie does to the Monsterverse.This movie doesn't feel like it fits into this series of films. Which is odd, because it's definitely supposed to. Godzilla's there, Kong's there, there are Psychovultures, Leafwings, Skullcrawlers, and characters from the previous film show up as well...But it feels like the overarching timeline of this universe was mostly ignored in the movie.The first two films in the Monsterverse fit perfectly together. Even though Skull Island was a bit more action oriented than Godzilla, I have no problem believing that they were in the same universe.King of the Monsters was odd. I could understand from watching the movie that it was a MV film, but it introduced a bunch of sci-fi crap that initially doesn't seem to belong in the universe. I say initially because you get used to it over time.As for GvK...It's not the technology that gets me, it's the seemingly nonexistent acknowledgement of the previous movies that really gets me.Millions of people were displaced in KotM. Multiple cities were destroyed, including Washington D. C. That's never acknowledged in this movie, at least not in a way that I noticed. Alan Jonah doesn't get mentioned in this movie at all, even though he's the one who acquired one of Ghidorah's head. Dr. Serizawa and Dr. Graham don't get any sort of memorial in this movie, even though they were extremely pivotal characters in both Godzilla and KotM. Admiral Stenz is nowhere to be found here, and it's never mentioned as to why. I seriously could go on with things that this movie doesn't acknowledge, but this review would be way longer than it should be.The opening sequence does a fine job of recapping the past three movies, but that alone doesn't do enough. There needs to be things inserted inside the whole film that connect to the other films. There are very few examples of this in the film.I'm not saying that the movie should give us some overly long and boring recap of the other movies. However, what I am saying is that there should have been a bigger attempt to connect this movie with the past movies throughout the run time. Maybe add a scene were Bernie and Madison talk about her mom, or maybe a scene where Walter and Ren argue about Ren's father.Other than what I said above, there are only two things that I don't like with the movie itself, and they have to do with some of the characters.Rebecca Hall's acting was pretty mediocre. Sometimes it was good, but other times it was pretty bad.I also didn't like how underutilized Ren Serizawa was. He is supposed to be Dr. Serizawa's son, but you wouldn't know that unless you're a big Monsterverse fan. He just kinda exists in this movie, and then he gets brain-blasted by Mecha-G.So... Yeah.

The balance of titan action vs. Human plot is much better in Godzilla vs. Kong. It's not perfect yet, but it is the closest to it that they've gotten so far. The movie's pacing approaches frenetic at times, then slows down just long enough to give us time to breath before picking back up again. The plot contains just enough aspects of Toho silliness to pay tribute, but not enough to taint it for the more modern taste.And the action! Like the other entries, the fights start out as teasers, with a few fillers tossed in for good measure, but when the showdown starts, hold on to your pants. It's knock down, drag out, no holds barred fun. Not as tense as I would have liked, with one possible exception, but overall the best action in the MonsterVerse to date.The only real negative in the movie is that, due to the nature of this particular story, there was only one of a few outcomes possible.

The former provides emotional grounding for viewing Kong as a heroic character and not just a ferocious monster. The latter provides much-needed humor in a very violent and generally dark story. So, one might ask next, what is wrong about this movie? Almost everything else. As in so many loud, special-effects laden Hollywood \"blockbusters,\" there is no real story arc or development of the characters, resulting in both plot holes and unanswered questions (e.g., what's Rebecca Hall's character's relationship with Kaylee's character, and why does the cynical young character of \"Josh,\"\nwho believes the podcaster is crazy, even hang around with Millie Bobby Brown's character, who listens to and believes wholeheartedly in his theories? And poor Kyle Chandler (yes, Coach Taylor), playing her dad, has little to say and even less to do. Skarsgard's character is the only one seen to evolve even a little; appropriate, since the IRL story is that Alexander actually learned ASL on set to communicate with Kaylee.

This was followed up by the \"very much a B Movie\" KONG: SKULL ISLAND where Samuel L. Jackson, John Goodman and a host of others run around, getting picked off one-by-one in an enjoyable romp and hopes remained high for the ongoing Kong/Godzilla \"Universe\".Unfortunately, 2019's GODZILLA: KING OF THE MONSTERS was a step down and the franchise showed signs of weakness with weaker plot lines...even weaker human characters...and overblown special effects.Next came this film, GODZILLA vs. KONG - it was supposed to be released in theaters last summer, but because of the pandemic made it's theatrical release at the same time it was shown on HBO Max (where I viewed it) - and I'm glad they did that, for if I would have shelled out money in a movie theater to check out this mess, I would have been angry, indeed.GODZILLA vs. KONG follows, unfortunately, the trend started by GODZILLA: KING OF THE THE MONSTERS in that it has overblown CGI action with very little in the way of coherent plot and characters that you couldn't care less about. It's a mess of a movie that strings together a slim plot to get from one CGI battle to another.But...if it has CGI Giant Gorilla on CGI Radioactive Lizard fighting in it...it should be fine, right? Well...that's where Director Adam Wingard (YOU'RE NEXT) really fails, for a movie called GODZILLA vs. KONG has very little Kong fighting Godzilla in it...so one cannot even get too excited by that.To be fair to this film, it doesn't try to be anything more than it is intended to be - a \"B\" flick with giant monsters fighting each other, but...it only manages to be a B- flick at best. So, feel free to kick back and watch the CGI action, you'll enjoy most of it - just don't spend too much time looking for plot or characters that you care about.And...unfortunately...it's making me care less and less about future sequels - or the future of the Kong/Godzilla Universe.Letter Grade: B-6 stars (out of 10) and you can take that to the Bank (ofMarquis)"}, {"reviewer_name": "MJB784", "date": "2 April 2021", "text": "The action scenes and special effects were very exciting, but most of the characters had nothing to do and the pacing was uneven where some of it meandered.

While most people will want that from a movie with that title, some will complain about the lack of character development in the film. And I don't think that's an issue at all. One of the biggest issues with the previous movies in the series, was the overly reliability of the human characters. In this movie, they are just there, either to deliver exposition or stand around. Which is fine, I didn't come to see the movie to watch humans, I came for the big monsters.The main character here is Kong, which I am greatful for. We have had 2 movies of Godzilla, we have only spent 1 movie with Kong, and here, he is basically the main character. The emotion this giant ape translates to screen is brilliant (props to the amazing visual effects department on that). You feel more for Kong than you do for anything else in the movie, aside from the very cute young deaf girl. I would love to see a future movie with these 2 being central.My biggest issue with this film is its runtime. I feel like this movie could have benefited from another 30 minutes or so. It was very fast paced, and wrapped up so quickly, you will hardly have time to process the epic final battle. I feel like there is more of this movie sitting on the cutting room floor, and maybe they will give us an extended version of this film, because there is clearly a lot missing.Godzilla vs Kong will deliver on exactly what most of us want - a epic monster flick that has amazing visuals, an great soundtrack, brilliant action scenes and a great main character in Kong.

I was grinning like a little kid for almost the entire last hour, and I was happy with how much the promotional footage and trailers didn't show.As a huge Godzilla fan, this really scratched almost every itch I have when coming into a Godzilla film. I say almost every because there's nothing here that's particularly deep at all; nothing that amounts to social commentary or anything interesting going on thematically. This keeps it from being an absolutely top-tier Godzilla film, as the best Japanese ones tend to combine fun monster action with some simple but interesting themes to think about (the aforementioned Shin Godzilla being one of them).The other flaw is almost everything that goes on with Millie Bobby Brown's character and her storyline. It feels like it's there to pad out the runtime, and even with me willingly suspending my disbelief at the vast majority of ridiculous stuff in this movie, the ease in which her and some other characters were able to sneak into a super secret high-tech facility was just a bit too far fetched. There's a good payoff to that subplot, but those scenes are easily the film's weakest point.I'd say a lot of the humour doesn't work too, besides one legitimately funny callback joke during the climax. I mean, a lot of the action made me laugh because of how over the top and fun it is, but the attempts at actual jokes almost always fall flat.(Oh, and it's a tiny nitpick, but it would be cool if they called the monsters kaiju instead of titans. But that's probably just a personal thing).Thankfully, the humans aren't entirely useless. The humans that interact with Kong and propel his storyline are decent enough, and I did really like the little girl who could communicate with Kong through sign language.In the end, though, there's not much human stuff at all, with an emphasis on spectacle and action, and there's so much of it here that I can easily recommend this for Godzilla fans and fans of monster movies in general. The biggest fight sequence in the movie is particularly well shot with some really nifty camerawork (is it camerawork if it's all cgi? I don't know.

Bichir's villain is too cartoonish and doesn't feel like a character from this cinematic universe, but Eiza's character is fun and enjoyable in some scenes.

Along the way there have been some hits and misses, this latest one is in the middle ground. This was one of the most anticipated movies for me in 2021 and I wasn't entirely disappointed. For starters the human cast is impressive with Alexander Skarsgard, Millie Bobby Brown (Stranger Things), Rebecca Hall, Kyle Chandler, Demian Bichir and our own Ronny Chieng. Then you've got the Titans in the title roles themselves. I liked how they still retained the look of the original movie monsters, but with a 2021 refresh and amazing CGI. What I could do without is Bryan Tyree Henry as the annoying Podcaster, Bernie Hayes. A wasteful, unnecessary, also unfunny sub plot that does nothing for this movie except introduce people who can bypass top flight security...somehow. The normally very funny Kiwi actor, Julian Dennison (star of Hunt for the Wilderpeople and Subway TV ad), was completely wasted in this movie. Watching the legends of \"Godzilla vs. Kong\" collide is in itself a spectacular battle royale staged in Hong Kong which is more like Tron Kong will all its neon lighting. No one who lives or has visited Honkers will recognise the place. You know why? Most of this nearly 2 hour flick was filmed in Queensland and Hawaii. Miami High School students might even see their own Backpack racks, just don't expect to see these creatures wiping out Queen St. Mall, or Fortitude Valley. Even at 113 minutes it's still the shortest film of the Monsterverse. Middle Earth (Gold Coast Hinterland) gets a makeover as Hollow Earth and let's face it that theory of life at the centre of our planet has been on the back burner for hundreds of years. I really liked some of the retro references to the origins of the back story and links to \"Kong-Skull Island\". The soundtrack was oddly out of pace with anything happening on the big screen like the Hollies classic \"Air That I Breathe\", but listen out for composer Junkie XL's biggest bass drum on the planet. A good popcorn film with stunning visual effects on a 200 million dollar budget. Oddly no Easter Eggs at the end of this movie, so when the credits role at the Cinema just get out and let the cleaners do their job, or better still pick your own mess and bin it. Good Stuff: First film in 58 years to feature both King Kong and Godzilla. Bad Stuff: As Action, SciFi goes this was a roller coast ride of fun, but a bit of filler and not all Thriller.

Godzilla vs Kong\nIf you were a fan of previous 3 movies of the mosterverse, this movie also has amazing direction. However it is very different from the rest 3 in story. Personally, I was very disappointed with this. (You might have a different opinion/ my personal opinion). I couldnt digest all the future tech/ advance tech/ pointless teenagers in the movie. According to me, titans are primitive species, who battle to show the supremacy over the other. The movie tries to show the origin universe of kong, which definitely promises you a nolan-level-adventure trip, but miserably becomes self contradictory. The advanced tech in the movie, makes the movie too much sci-fic. And I am literally tired of all this pointless teenagers, bypassing all security and aiding the titans. The fight sequence I was expecting, was fabulous, but lasted only for some time towards the end,\nThis was definitely worth a watch. MAJOR SPOILERS AHEADThey are showing a titan universe. Well, thats acceptable, natural landscape with a few gravity factors. But,\n1) Who made the kong sculpture? 2) Where does the axe come from? 3) Why does the axe have a imprint. When you place it there, it magically draws power and godzilla symbol flashes? 4) The lady even says this is an advance technology. Arent they a primitive species? Who made all this even\n5) Kong even has a giant throne? Projecting himself to be at the center with a palace? 6) Whats all that thing about scanning energy source? 7) Whats that concept of mechgorzilla having a conscience of its own? 8) Neurological link from the ancient head? 9) This is not pacific rim lol. 10) Literally,? The girl is calls her dad in America, during fight. And he reaches hong kong in minutes. Wow\n11) The kids bypassing all security. Gets trapped. Accidentally reveals the whole plan. Sound familiar.? 12) Seriously? Emp for kong and kong setting his dislocated shoulder himself. 13) Kong can speak and comes from advanced tech. But doesnt understand mechgorzilla is the villain.

The semblance of a plot to speak of any is that Godzilla is lurking with intent, and to prevent a reckoning between Kong and Godzilla (stick with me here) Kong must be transported to his own home world (Skull Island?) and on his way there Godzilla attacks!! However, there's more, there are some nasty corporate scientists types who want to harness the energy on said Kong home world and have a devious plan to syphon this energy in a very convoluted story strand which serves the purpose of some massive fisticuffs, cue carnage...The main point of recommendation for this movie is the emphasis on the showdown. The side scrolling beat 'Em up visuals of old Godzilla is reincarnated for the modern screen in full blooded CGI and makes for a marvelous spectacle. Kong is given a good amount of heart and emotes to the screen well, conveying a sense of ennui befitting a noble beast, this in of itself is quite an achievement. When you throw in Godzilla and his own sense of purposeful angst and devotion to the better angels of our nature, you have a duo of staggering proportions fighting for a cause that the audience are not quite sure of but support none the less. If there are any deficiencies it is the lack of scale to these battles. Hong Kong is rendered and torn down in a blink of an eye with very little moment of pause. This would have served as an interesting third perspective, think Cloverfield or the likes. Alas, cities are torn to shreds with very little discussion of collateral damage. This would have given the movie a little more of what it needed. In the end it is a massive beat down between two of cinemas greatest visual icons.All this being said there are some much needed surprises along the way, I didn't see the trailer and was fortunate to not know what was coming, so will not spoil it here, but there is an ace up the sleeve which when it arrives gives the audience another wow wow wee ha moment.This is bombastic if a little brainless fun, which most certainly delivers on the visual scale. What must be noted is that almost exactly a year on since Covid restrictions across the globe, this is a little reminder of how blockbuster movies used to be pre lockdown: loud, silly and ultimately forgettable.

On an objective level, this was the first major event film since the tragic pandemic that devastated the world in March of 2020. Even with the film available to stream for free on HBO Max at home, theaters were still packed with viewers hungry to experience the clash of arguably cinema's 2 most iconic characters the way it was meant to; on the big screen.On a more subjective level, this is Adam Wingard's first major Hollywood franchise blockbuster. I've long been adamant on how Wingard is my favorite director working today and he couldn't ask for a greater responsibility than adapting this ambitious clash between cinema's greatest titans. Additionally, like the simian protagonist of his film, Wingard comes into this scenario an underdog, as most of the Legendary MonsterVerse films have tended to lean towards \"bad\" instead of \"good.\" I actually liked Godzilla (2014), though it was far from great and nowhere near most of its Japanese predecessors. Kong: Skull Island was unfathomably stupid and Godzilla: King of the Monsters was one of my worst films of 2019.I am happy to say that Adam Wingard has beat the odds and crushed the bell on this proverbial high striker.For fans that complained about the lack of focus on the Kaiju in previous Godzilla films, lament no longer. This is entirely their show and, unlike the previous Legendary MonsterVerse films, treats them with respect and engrossment as developed and fleshed out characters rather than titanic death machines of destruction. Kong is the lovable, goofy underdog, very true to his characterization in the original Showa King Kong vs. Godzilla of the 1960s. His very first introduction is an endearingly lethargic and light hearted morning routine played to 60s pop heartthrob Bobby VInton's cover of Over the Mountain, Across the Sea. Complimenting this friendly characterization is Kong's love and gravitation towards children; specifically towards a sweet Skull Island native named Jia, played with moving concern and raw, beating heart by the immensely talented newcomer, Kaylee Hottle.Kong is nowhere near as intimidating or imposing as Godzilla, and Wingard recognizes this, giving the character a deeply satisfying hero's journey that slowly takes him from lovable, childlike loser to proud warrior and descendant of a prestigious family legacy to heir to the throne for the King of the Monsters. It's not just a massive improvement from Kong's sedentary and passive role in Skull Island, it's one of the most emotionally resonant and strongest character arcs in blockbuster history, hinging entirely on the base elements of filmmaking due to its focus on a silent character.Much has been made of Godzilla not having as much a focus in the narrative as Kong and I think this criticism is rather overblown. Godzilla has always worked best in mystery and one of the best aspects of the 2014 film was its adherence to keeping him always somewhat of an enigma. It's a similar case here, but it's also the most character and development that Godzilla has had since 2004's Tokyo S. O. S. In Godzilla vs. Kong, he plays the unprecedented dual role of both minor antagonist and mentor. He's getting too old to fight titans and there are many indications (especially later in the film) that he's not quite as quick as he used to be. Godzilla needs someone new to take over as heir and the headstrong Kong makes for the most credible candidate. The radioactive reptile puts Kong through hell testing his abilities, but that moment of acceptance and respect he finally lays upon the mighty ape when deeming him worthy to claim the throne when he leaves is an immensely powerful moment of visual storytelling.Many have claimed that a Godzilla film doesn't need strong human characters to be good. That's nonsense. A good Godzilla movie needs strong characters and story just as much as every other film and, while they don't have quite the development Kong or Godzilla do, they're still the best the MonsterVerse has had by far. Millie Bobbie Brown's Madison Russell actually has a personality and motivations that make sense this time around, which is already an improvement on her blank slate from King of the Monsters and make for a much stronger performance. Rebecca Hall has never been better in a very Sarah Harding-esque stubborn and reckless adventurer sort of role, it's a shame she doesn't do more pulp characters like this. Demian Bechir's Walter Simmons is a bit obvious as the human villain, but his performance is so genuinely scary and monstrous that I didn't even mind.Stealing the show from the entire human cast, however, is Brian Tyree Henry as Bernie Hayes. One of the funniest comic relief characters in decades, Hayes plays the character as endearingly awkward and eccentric with a big heart and oozing charisma. His podcast conspiracy theorist easily could have come across as caricature, but he's actually a very interesting character, a hopeless soul trying to find cryptic meaning in a world that's lost purpose. A scatter brained, brilliant underdog genuinely trying to do the right thing in a position of very little power. While Kong's arc and his relationship with Jia comprise most of the heart in the film, Bernie's wonderful portrayal of a lovable lower class maverick has plenty of soul on its own.There's so much I want to talk about here. I could talk about how this film has the best soundtrack I've heard since Spider-Verse. I could talk about how the vivid, fluorescent use of the Hong Kong cityscape creates a visual style completely distinct and different for an over 30 film franchise of Godzilla movies. I could talk about how this is probably the scariest and most culturally relevant take on Mechagodzilla of all time.

It is here, that Godzilla Vs. Kong makes its appearance within this arena, adapting to a wide, or paradoxically, possibly a narrow, contemporary audience that holds its bated breath with excitement and anticipation. Holding one's breath whilst waiting for the great finale is not a particularly good practice and certainly not recommended; If one were to hold one's breath, we'd be holding-out until time eternal and with no contention of a second bout in sight.We are being sold a one-way ticket to this extravaganza that leaves its reputation only in the visual, and pumps less iron where needed declaring that it is not how you start, but how you finish. The neutral positions of both contenders start with chest beating and erupts into facebusting plancha's and lariat tumblr's that releases tie-up after tie-up.Comprising a higher percentage of action than diction, this is an easy road to glory when the Titan's rumble with the ethos of never giving up, never backing down and never losing faith; until the bitter end. Unfortunately, it will be how we shall best remember this bout and all that unravels around the ropes and bouncing off the turnbuckle's set at close quarters within this squared circle of celluloid; everything else is fodder and inconsequential.Where strength and weakness conjoin here is the calling timeout of throwing in the towel of the abysmal, easily deposable ticker tape character development and any substantial plot. What are, exactly, are these parties achieving to enhance the narrative? Sadly, any screen time by Ms. Bobby Brown and her subplot adventures only ridicule's the tensions of the main event; whilst not to demonise her onscreen charisma, her dropping from A-Show to no-show B-Show here only disappoints and deflates any warranted tension; too, with the conjuncture of babyfaced Kaylee Hottle and Mr. Skarsg\u00e5rd for example, at best, simply add tedium and both hit the ground with a heavy bump that echoes throughout the whole debacle. The aphorism of less is more, albeit with an international cast, may have been appropriate to the overall quality of the narrative.Within the, alleged, universe of the WWE, we are driven to the point of understanding that what we see is not necessarily what actually is: we came; we saw; we understand what our senses are being cajoled into believing that all is good and all is beyond the superficial. Understandably, too, this is where the parallels of the WWE and the celluloid bout of Godzilla and Kong merge.

All the financial and production resources in the world can't hide the weaknesses in the script.The fourth in the Monsterverse series this battle of the titans spends too much time with the convoluted plot which eventually includes a Journey To The Center Of The Earth style subplot and a modern version of one of Godzilla's old robot rivals( there's even a credit for a \"Monsterverse Mythology Consultant\"!) . And, who knew that Kong was a fan of the Thor?!There are a couple of nice bits and some of the action is decent. Junkie XL (Adam Holkenborg)'s music isn't bad and the idea of using pops songs kind of works -- at least the first time in the movie. The SFX are fine. The cast is ok but the acting honors go to Kaylee Hottle as the deaf girl who befriends Kong. Of course, she has the advantage of not having to spout any of the lame dialogue. And, what is up with the conspiracy angle which even uses Q-Anon buzzwords like \"Storm Track\" and \"Bleach\"? Odd.The ending leaves open the possibility of more sequels and, nowadays, it's every studio's dream to have a never-ending \"Universe\" of their own.

I honestly don't know what more you can expect from a monster feature like this - it's all here. However, despite it strengths, it does have a few weaknesses, but thankfully, they aren't enough to take away from the overall experience.Our story starts on Skull Island where Kong has been placed inside a massive, containment structure in the hopes of protecting him from the outside, most notably Godzilla - who they are sure will seek Kong out simply to establish himself as the alpha titan. However, when a power surge is discovered under the earth's crust, they set Kong on the trail in hopes that he will lead them to it, and what they believe to be the origin and source of the titans. Hot on his trail though, is Godzilla and soon the long anticipated, fated duel between the two becomes imminent.I really enjoyed this movie. It hits the mark for its intended audience. However, as mentioned before, it comes with its share of problems. I just felt parts of the plot fell together a little too neatly (ie: the time to reach Hollow Earth, as they refer to it, was far too short and easy - Kong knowing sign language who communicates with the little mute girl was just a bit too hokey for me - Mechagodzilla losing control was clearly just a McGuffin to keep the plot moving in the direction they needed it to). And yet, despite these, the film still works.I highly recommend \"Godzilla vs. Kong\" at a very strong 8 stars out of 10. I had a lot of fun watching it. The effects and CG work were top notch that made all of the action between our two titans effective and believable. The characters were strong and the acting pretty good.

In a nutshell, this film was a mix of Jurassic Park meets Skynet. The team King Kong vs team Godzilla debate is liable to lean towards team Kong. This is a team Kong movie with Godzilla in it. I feel as if this movie is a movie geared for the fans and we finally got a first glimple of Mecha-Godzilla in modern CGI form since the rubber suit days.The film is basically about a corporation that is tasked with the goal of achieving power over the Alpha Titan Godzilla. Apex Corp. Builds a robotic Godzilla, named Mecha-Godzilla, fueled with the soul and spirit derived from the genetic memories in the DNA of Ghidorah, the 3-headed Dragon. The goal of Apex Corp. Is the create a mind controlled Mecha-Godzilla, a clone, built in the image of Godzilla, but whose mind is in the control of the corporation, so that the corporate elite humans on planet Earth can maintain their grip and control on Earth.Godzilla tries to prevent the creation of his clone and destroys an entire lab. Kong is released from his world by his Monarch. Corp. Monitors in order to stop Godzilla from his attacks, not realizing why Apex corp. Was up to. The result is two big fights, resulting in a win for both, each winning one round. Kong loses the first fight after almost drowning but after he finds a secret weapon in a fantastical hollow Earth setting, a place where Alpha Titans come from, a weapon that allows Kong to gain advantage over the alpha king Godzilla.Eventually, Kong and Godzilla eventually put their differences aside in order to combat the bigger threat; -Mecha-Godzilla. Mecha-Godzilla eventually cuts the strings of it's creator's control and rebels against it's corporate maker, in biblical fashion. Did I like it as much as the last film, \"King of Monsters?\" I did like the action and fights and it was very high tech, with space ships and DNA supercomputers. I think it was a very different film than the last one and hard to compare.

However, I don't think I could say that Godzilla vs Kong did.The film has essentially two storylines that surround the behemoths' battle and each is equally ridiculous, confusing and comprised of bland characters. It's nearly impossible to follow what's going and at times I dont think the film knows what it's doing either. It just goes through the motions checking of scenes so it can get to the next fight sequence. There characters and scenarios that just pop in and out without ever explaining themselves (which might be hard to believe considering the bombardment of exposition). The picture is structured by a pattern that consists of exposition, action and also some sentiment stuffed in your face in some pathetic effort to flesh out this film. All that actually does is add some extra frustration to already dead scenes.Godzilla vs Kong is everything you might expect, if you have the right expectations.

The characters are absolutely atrocious. None of them are relatable at all and have almost no motivation or reason to be in the story. When the story focuses on the characters, it becomes an absolute drag. It's unbearable at points because the dialogue is terrible. I know some might say that the characters aren't the important part of the film and that's true but the characters are essential for some of these events to happen so they can't be overlooked. The action between Godzilla and Kong is pretty good. It's not great but it's entertaining and has its moments although sometimes, the story gets too weird for me to think about. The more I think about the story, the more disjointed and weaker it becomes. It's good in the moment but not very good the more you think about. The visual effects though are pretty great. Godzilla and Kong look very really and some of these environments look great. The directing is passable at best. I'm not a big fan of Adam Wingard though so that might be why.

I am a Godzilla fanboy so every time there is a new Godzilla movies either Toho or anything else made me fall in love with Godzilla. I love Godzilla and so seeing this movie with him fighting against Kong. And if you can't tell I was 100% team Godzilla. And from what we got it delivered Adam Wingard did confirm we will have a clear winner and WE got that. Godzilla won baby. However I do STILL respect King Kong as he did in fact give Godzilla a good fight. And the fight with MechaGodzilla versus Kong and Godzilla was the creme de la creme on top as I knew MechaGodzilla would be in the movie and Kong and Godzilla would in fact team up to beat him. It was a movie to see in theaters and NOT on HBO Max. And sure the human characters again get in the way and stuff however one character Jia was the best one out of all of them and the fact that she had the strongest relationship with Kong was perfect to make me care about Kong even more. And yes the characters such as Madison and Ren Serizawa infidelity needed more time to shin, especially Ren who was the son of the Dr. Ishiro Serizawa, yeah he definetly needed more time to develop and show WHY he hates Godzilla. All in all and if you can see the film for me was a blast and it was the perfect stepping stone for people to go back to the theaters. 10/10 Perfect."}, {"reviewer_name": "ravidm-28116", "date": "3 April 2021", "text": "So much hype about this so I decided to give it a try.I am so glad I watched this.

The forums are littered with promotional advertising in the guise of 'word of mouth', but it is all fake.The movie came out, I watched it and it is pretty poor on all counts.The graphics and fight scenes, let us start with those. The people keep saying these were the best parts of the movie. Well, not in my view. The visuals are pretty poor because of the awful awful lighting used in the CGI scenes, which is about 99% of the movie. The monsters, particularly Kong look very average. The skin rendering and fur are particularly poor.Be prepared for 50% of the movie to have bloom and over blurring of bright light effects all over the screen, so good luck trying to see any details or focus on anything specific; it is like they wanted to hide everything away with the lighting. Anyway, the fights were pretty boring, the music was so-so. The choreography was average.The other poor parts of the movie was the plot with the generic evil corporation. The human characters were following completely dry plot points, and were not needed. These moments were forced and dull. Anything with the kid actor from 'Stranger Things' was a complete waste.Was there anything outstanding in the movie? Not really. I think that CGI movie blue screen cinema has reached new levels of idiocy here, and everything else is so bland.5/10 average movie that needs a lot of work on character writing, plots, storytelling, acting, and music.

Godzilla vs Kong takes its monsterverse franchise as it explores and is able to set lots of films & narrative structure for the future. The movie provides a satisfying experience. I mean, I went in for the Big CGI monster fight, with some character development & a normal story to thrive with as a side experience. And that's what you will get if you watch this movie.The movie holds lots of promise, a good Cinematography, good scenic beauty & cool action shots. Basically what anyone would want to watch in this movie in usual.The movie has used good soundtracks. The VFX is convincing, it however fell for me at some points.Mainly the Graphics of the water. Kind of looked unconvincing. But other than that, the VFX of the movie was beautiful.Godzilla vs Kong is a huge leap in the whole franchise. Most of the parts its a beautifully shot, filled with action, and with a small touch up of emotions from the character.The movie focuses more on Kong & less on Godzilla. And when I say \"less\", I mean very less. They have done quite a good job building Kong. But the movie is supposed to be about both Kong & Godzilla. There was enough, actually more than enough of Kong but very less of Godzilla.They did focus on Kong a lot, he had a kind of conscious when he was fighting the battles. He used his brain & some combat skills, which is quite appreciatable. But then again, \"More Kong & Less Godzilla\".The second thing which I didn't like about this movie would be that I thought the character of Millie Bobby Brown was shoved down our throats. She wasn't really needed in that movie. Her entire story arc wasn't necessary, and her contribution towards the narrative wasn't that crucial. What I here mean to say is there were loads of another way to push the story forward. But I get it, her & her team was there to give us a few laugh and create a sense of emergency or the sense that something is really at stake here. But then again, we already know that. The movie is about two big titans figting untill one bows.I liked the film as whole, the action sequences were well shotIn short, this movie was a much needed in the monsterverse franchise to push it a little bit forward. To construct and form foundation for more storylines to come. The story provided by them was normal. There wasn't any depth to it, but who really needs depthness in a movie which is about big CGI monsters fighting each other to death. Still they had convincing characters. Of course they fell to some clich\u00e9 stuff at some points. But that's ohk.So yes Godzilla v Kong is a great action tale.

The human cast are again entirely forgettable.We want monster mayhem with carnage on a massive scale!We don't want to sit through forty minutes of poorly written dialogue and exposition in order to get to the smack downs.Wingard appreciates this and serves the fans promptly. This is a tightly paced movie.The plot...Nah, you're not interested in that! As long as our two titular titans cross paths and exchange blows. That's what the audience really cares about. And boy oh boy, they do!The fight scenes are expertly staged with some extraordinary camerawork.Almost as if the camera was mounted to the Titans limbs as they swing and swipe at one another.The monsters look and feel gigantic. 'Pacific Rim : Uprising' need take notes here.Every punch is felt with concussive impact.With total disregard for surrounding properties, entire cities are trashed as the two apex creatures go toe to toe.If you thought the destruction in 'Man Of Steel' was excessive, then you haven't seen nothing yet!There has to be a definitive winner.No spoilers here, there is one Titan who does come out on top but not before several rounds of punishment.After all the poster does read \"One Will Fall!\"\nI'll admit I was team Godzilla going in but Kong is depicted as the underdog and we all love an underdog.Kong is like Rocky Balboa but with more body hair.The first battle at sea is genuinely epic. CGI is absolutely astonishing.We have clearly reached a point in terms of filmmaking. If your imagination and budget is big enough, anything is possible.Technically 'Godzilla Vs Kong' is very well made.It's not going to get any nods at the Oscars for best actor or screenplay but visual effects and sound design are worthy of such an accolade.Cinematography is stunning. Again the battle at sea looking sublime.The climatic battle in the city is an HDR showcase with neon lights bursting with colour.The scenes depicting Hollow Earth are a visual feast. Skylines are gorgeously rendered.I for one will be buying the 4K Blu-ray on release day just for the audio and visual splendour alone. This brings me to the audio.Anyone who has read my review will know that I regard the sound mix on 'King Of Monsters' to be demo worthy.If you have a dedicated Home Cinema system or even a decent soundbar, then you are in for a treat. Low frequency effects are foundation shaking. This movie probably doesn't punch as hard as its predecessor. Certainly not on a streaming platform anyway.We shall have to wait for the physical release\nto hear if the disc has an equally thunderous sound mix.Still for a digital stream the Dolby Atmos sound mix is very impressive.As you'd expect bass is served in giant sized dollops as the two Titans go toe to claw.Surround sound placement is excellent making for a truly immersive experience. A movie that shouldn't be played through weedy TV speakers!'Godzilla Vs Kong' is all we hoped it could be.After the excellent trailer and marketing build up. This movie pays off for the fans.It's true that the movie is littered with flaws and plot holes. For instance. How as human technology jumped forward a hundred years since the events in the first 'Godzilla' (2014)?I chuckled to myself as the futuristic crafts known as HEAVS that the humans fly around in resembled flying pot bellied pigs.Pigs may indeed fly because anything is possible in this movie!Forget logic or reason.Just go with it.

After seeing all the previous Monsterverse flicks, I was never too impressed. I found 2014's Godzilla to be rather dull, and Godzilla King of Monsters to be a bit overstuffed. Kong Skull Island was a step up for the franchise, but it did feel like something was still missing, and now finally the franchise is able to bring it home with this film. I was entertained nearly the whole way through. The CGI is fantastic as expected, and there are so many fun action scenes throughout, you can't help but be impressed. The story can be rather interesting, it balancing a few different plots at once with just enough sci-fi nonsense to keep you engaged. The acting isn't anything grand, as expected, but I do appreciate us stepping away a bit more from Godzilla and Kyle Chandler's science team this time around, cause their roles feel anything but natural by the end. There is a huge wonde factor when it comes to this film, which was exactly what i wanted.

It had great looking monsters, a very good musical score, not the best Human characters in the world sure, but a plot that made sense to get all these monsters out to attack and some nice references to the franchise as well. It truly felt like the movie hardcore Godzilla fans wanted, despite the divisive nature of it between Audiences and Critics on what a Godzilla film should deliver on.Godzilla vs. Kong on the other hand felt like a downgrade in places to me. Why? Well I know this might sound a bit odd, but I felt the Human characters were weaker in this one than King of the Monsters. There were character arcs in King of the Monsters that lead our protagonists to releasing and dealing with the monsters with clear narratives/emotional beats from start to finish. In Godzilla vs. Kong, there's loads of subplots that are happening at the same time and characters from the previous film are left to the side doing almost nothing at all. People might see this as an upgrade, but I personally feel it hurts the film, and it's not as satisfying to watch how they get from point A to point B this time around.The Sci-fi element has been ramped up to bonkers level here. This is one thing I can't decide if it's a good thing or bad thing. It looks visually great for sure, and I would have loved to have seen this on the big screen, but I started to question whether any of it made sense and was kind of lazy. So what about the big fights then? That's the thing that matters the most for Godzilla films right? Yeah, they deliver, although this time around it's a bit more contrived on how they fight. It doesn't feel as satisfying of a buildup to them as King of the Monsters, but Godzilla fighting Kong is exactly what you get, and MechaGodzilla is there too but gets the short end of the stick sadly. I still think King Ghidorah is the best looking monster we've had.Music is fine. It's not quite as good, but it's not bad either. I feel the film is more focused on King Kong than Godzilla, so he gets more screentime and has a character arc/redemption story with Godzilla just sort of there in spades. It plays out exactly as you expect it would, and the end winner is probably the most realistic outcome. So despite all that, I still had a good time with Godzilla vs. Kong. It's the type of film you're not meant to think too hard on for a deep storyline and simply enjoy the ride as a spectacle, and I believe it mostly delivers on that if you go in with the right mindset.7/10."}, {"reviewer_name": "afb_bellman", "date": "1 April 2021", "text": "This was paced pretty well, I stayed interested the whole time.

With humanity caught in the balance.I personally had an absolute blast with this film. The cinematography and set pieces were incredible. The character designs were amazing. The set up was great. Some of the characters were very likeable. The action was absolutely insane and by far the best parts of the movie. I really liked the connection between the little girl and Kong. I also loved the mystery of the two different sides to the people helping Kong and trying to get rid of Godzilla. A lot of the cast did have good chemistry with each other. There was some really interesting characters especially the little girl. The sound design was incredible, it was very funny in places. I liked the two different storylines that were told. The building of tension and rising of stakes was excellent. The movie was just extremely entertaining. The characters were actually clever which made a change, and the worldbuilding was fantastic. The plot twists and added explanation to the plot was great. The villains and the camerawork was fun and creative. And the final act was just incredible.However, there was a lack of explanation to certain plot points at the beginning. There were personally too many characters for me with a lack of depth to them so I didn't connect to some of them, and the script was fairly weak In places.But overall, Godzilla vs Kong is absolutely incredible. Is it masterfully written with excellent human characters, no. But that's not what the film was about.

Even Skull Island surprised me with how good it actually was, while King of the Monsters tried to weave in a contrived human story full of annoying characters that detracted from its best moments; namely Godzilla fighting a whole bunch of other giant creatures.Godzilla vs. Kong steers closer to Skull Island than King of the Monsters, thankfully. There's still a hell of a lot of human drama here, half of which follows the most annoying characters from King of the Monsters, but none of it got in the way or actively detracted from the monster mashes. The human drama on Kong's side was equally nonsensical, but also full of far more wonder, as we follow them down to the Hollow Earth, a dimension between the Earth's crust and core, the original home of all these primal beasts. Both these side stories eventually merge together to re-introduce one of Godzilla's most infamous foes, but when the monster fights get going, no humans could possibly get in the way.So Godzilla is back and keeping the peace against other awakening titans, but his only appearances this time around are to turn up for a fight, whether that's against Kong or a cybernetics company in Florida, marking his first ever attack against humankind. So strictly speaking this movie is more of a Kong 2, as we follow his journey across the sea to Antarctica in order to travel through a tunnel in the Earth that leads to the Hollow Earth. There the humans hope to find a new power source that could save humanity, but for Kong it's about finding his family. Instead all he finds are ruins and a nice shiny axe perfect for killing lizard behemoths.The visual effects in this movie is simply breathtaking. These two titans have never looked so crisp and detailed. Kong enjoys some of the best rendering, giving him a full range of emotions, and putting his hairy body through all sorts of somewhat challenging environments. Just watching him angrily punch the Antarctic snow while his hair is caked in it was like you could reach out and touch him. Godzilla likewise enjoys a higher level of detail than seen before, keeping his bear-like inspiration and radiation-fuelled breath attacks, but also manages a surprising amount of emotion. I also thought it was brave pitting the final showdown in a brightly-lit Hong Kong, but damn does it look pretty. This isn't Pacific Rim: Uprising where the daylight fight looks like the filmmakers playing with actual toys, nor is it King of the Monsters where there's so much fog and dust that the action becomes concealed by a cloud of murky brown. This looks just as great as the night fights, with the added bonus of Hong Kong's neon lights. It's a fight full of clarity and moments worth screenshotting and mounting on your wall (or using as a wallpaper if you're a more modern connoisseur).These fights are full of some fantastic moments too. It's not just two monsters slapped together and aimlessly punching, kicking, tail-slapping, or fire-breathing over one another. Both of them show a genuine level of tactics as they try to counter the other's blows. Godzilla gets on all fours and charges Kong, Kong resets his dislocated shoulder on a building and uses every inch of his axe. Even the out-at-sea fight has Kong uses the fleet of ships to try and gain better footing, while Godzilla is content to use the ocean to his advantage, striking from below and dragging Kong ever deeper beneath the surface. They even team-up against the new threat by combining Kong's axe with Godzilla's radiation breath. Hong Kong gets absolutely decimated in the process, but damn that's kind of what we all came here for, right? Big monsters duking it out and the complete annihilation of whatever manmade structures get in the way.No-one in this movie is particularly stand-out from the rest of the cast (Godzilla and Kong excluded), which is disappointing. It would've been nice to have a half-decent human story alongside it, and even the more interesting side quest of travelling to Hollow Earth was still mired by unremarkable characters played by actors seeking an easy paycheck. The bond between Kong and the deaf girl was sweet as hell and is really that's worth mentioning, but it was nice to see Julian Dennison in a bigger movie than Hunt for the Wilderpeople, and Brian Tyree Henry had the most interesting character in conspiracy theorist Bernie, despite his sub-plot being dull at best and outright bad otherwise. Also worth mentioning that Lance Reddick only has one line despite being billed fairly high, and Kyle Chandler could've been non-existent.Ultimately, you want to see King Kong and Godzilla duke it out, and finally put to rest the question of who would win in a fight? This is the movie for you. It answers that definitively not once, but twice. There's no glossing over the winner in order to make fans of either one feel better; the winner here is resoundingly clear. If you want half-decent human drama, maybe just look back at the first two movies. Eventually Lionsgate and Warner Bros. Will realise that we're here for the big monsters and not for the boring humans who keep getting in the way and dying, so if they really need to give us humans, it better be for a really good reason.

The movie overall best describe as it's good it's not a great it's not excellent it's a good movie and it's deserving of being called a good movie. This movie delivers on what promises and it knows what the audience is here. When Godzilla and Kong are on screen the focus is clearly on them with action and more action. It doesn't beat around the bush it's satisfying. Theres moments Where Kong has the improvise to get the upper hand on Godzilla it's Creative,the fight scenes are more believable and I say that given the fact that overall the idea of the movie sounds great. However it's still put you in skepticism of the idea of a giant ape fighting such a tank of a monster like Godzilla when they're fighting Kong has to resort to other methods to hold his ground. He doesn't have atomic breath, he's not immune to battleship artillery. Though some would still argue that they're still and \"unbalance\" to these fights .The movie has Godzilla waging destruction on several locations. Nobody knows why he's randomly attacking these locations but it puts the world on edge and people start to doubt Godzilla as protector. Something else is going on here but you know he's looking for something. While Godzilla get his screentime and as always they really show off his destruction level.he doesn't appear solo on the screen as much as you would probably expect him to. The movies more heavily focused on Kong a majority of the first half of the movie is more dedicated to him there's a plot about the humans discussion the location of place called hollow Earth where these monster titans are believed to hail from including Kongs ancestors. They use Kong to try to find this location and power source that dwells there. Visually it's a good idea gives you more of a scope to production design. Hollow earth itself looks pretty beautiful it varies in the environments from jungle that are similar to Skull island to just barren wastelands. There's mirrored surfaces you look up at the sky you don't see a sky you see a whole other landmass with different Gravitational pulls. It's one of the Best highlights in the movie they try to do something more otherworldly. King Kong it's a little bit more strange for Godzilla it would be more appropriate. The human characters are thankfully pushed to the background a bit more but none of them you still don't care about and the writing for their dialogue is poorly written. It is constantly stated which still stands that humans are not the interesting part in these movies but they still keep giving a concern amount of scenes to them and try to make them more relevant to the task at hand with the monsters. Having them there to find out what is going on is pointless and the reveal which would still be just as surprising without them in it. It's the same as Godzilla King of the monsters a bunch of those moments that are dedicated to the humans are moments that you could've given to Godzilla in this movie. The one human character that's probably the best in the movie is a little girl from skull island who is able to Communicate with kong through sign language. A lot of the scenes with her and Kong express a ton of emotion you can see it not just on her face,but Kong face. How he feels about the situation It gives him more depth to his character. When you can see what he's feeling Kong's seen more Sympathetic and more of a hero, unlike Godzilla Who nobody can read more a villain. Personality characteristics that seems more fitting for the two. Godzilla versus Kong is a fun movie with tons of action pack scenes and satisfies both Godzilla and King Kong fans Alike with stunning visuals and great music After so many decades it's nice to see these two back on the big screen together."}, {"reviewer_name": "jamesc-26046", "date": "1 April 2021", "text": "If you expected this movie too be on par with something along the lines of the avengers or the Snyder cut, you're being irrational.

The two giants, who have been featured in blockbuster standalone films, come together for the first time, fighting for the 'alpha' position among themselves. First things first, you don't go for Kaiju movies for the writing they have, you go it for the purest form of entertainment it provides. The same is the case with Godzilla vs Kong, if you take into consideration the writing part of the movie, it is childish, illogical, and improbable. Also, there is plenty of technical advancement in machines, guns, and the atmosphere because of the timeline it runs in, almost making it a sci-fi movie. However, it hits the bullseye with its jaw-dropping CGI work and adrenaline-pumping background music, making it impossible to take your eyes off the screen. Both the Titans get their chances to shine and showcase their strength, which would not disappoint the people rooting for their favorite character.

Not as much as the first two Godzilla movies, but I was let down. It wastes far too much screen time on the poorly written human characters, you don't care about, and a convoluted plot, when all I wanted to see was Godzilla V Kong!! I've paid to see a monster movie, give me my monsters, damn you!!As you know, I was so excited for this movie, and it was so poorly handled, I was left sighing a lot, I was so annoyed by its plot, that I just didn't buy anything in it. Something that constantly took me out if it was the scaling of Godzilla and Kong, was inconsistent. They looked much bigger when they were trashing Hong Kong, than when they were on the aircraft, it looked great visually, but I had to think how on earth is that staying afloat under their combined weight.Amazingly, in a movie where all anyone wants to see is two Titans knock the s**t out of each other, there are 3 messy plots going on at once. It's full of plot holes, especially the sci/fi element, I can overlook a lot in movies, but it really made me tune out.1; The Kong plot; Stellan Skarsg\u00e5rd and Rebecca Hall take Kong to the Hollow Earth, to get some power thing, that's not 100% clear why, except the ulterior motive.2; The Godzilla is randomly attacking plot\n3; The totally pointless Millie Bobby Brown and her friends plot, which is easily the weakest one. Her character was front and centre during King Of The Monsters, why is she in school listening to a consioricy podcast?? Why is there even anything like this?? Were the events of the first two movies not covered by ANY news outlets?? You totally could have done away with these characters, and nothing in the other plots needed to change. And what happened at the end, with one poring a drink on a keyboard, was laughably bad!! A cleaner (wearing headphones of course) oblivious to the battle (as they always are), could have accidentally pulled the plug out, or a rat (like in Endgame) could have chewed a random wire and it wouldn't have been any stupider than what we got!!It's a very Kong centric movie, which I was glad about, as I'm Team Kong due to enjoying Skull Island, but I did not like either Godzilla movie. I turned off the first and walked out of the cinema during King Of Monsters.They did make Kong a little too human, though, especially during the opening as he scrathed his ass, en route to his morning shower. Was this so audiences known to root for King Kong. I have to say Godzilla is essentially a side character in his own movie.I could have done without the entire Journey To The Centre Of The Earth section, it feels like that was from another movie, entirely. One I would have gladly paid to see, but I did not care for it here. It just caused more plot holes. If Godzilla can so easily blast into middle earth, why isn't he just chilling in Hollow Earth?? But the charging of the axe section was ridiculous and sending data from a sample from middle earth, is not the same as them having an actual sample, so that was all bulls**t too. As was Kong travelling from the centre of the earth (approx 4000 miles) in no time at all.The majority of the humans were a waste of screen time. We only need one group of humans to follow in this type of movie!!In this we have a Stellan Skarsg\u00e5rd led gang with Kong and then the villains OK. But we also have Millie Bobby Brown (pointless), Bryan Tyree Henry (annoying) and Julian Dennison, whom I loved in Hunt For Wilderpeople, but he serves no purpose here, except for that one laughably bad thing at the end!! His character could have been merged with Henry's for one character and the movie would not have been any worse. Thankfully Kyle Chandler's role is reduced, as man, he can not act in these movies. I get a feeling a lot of his role is on the cutting room floor, not that I'm complaining, but I don't think Chandler would have signed on for three scenes!! My favourite human character was Kaylee Hottle as the deaf girlI had so many questions, watching it;\nHow did they build that dome on Skull Island??Why is Rebecca Andrews in charge of Kong?? Did I miss something in Skull Island??If Kong's ancestors wielded the axe before him, as they were battling Godzilla for decades, how old is Godzilla?? How long was Kong on Skull Island alone for??How did everyone get to Hong Kong so quickly?? Some of its issues with people travelling, reminded me of Game Of Thrones Season 8!! That's never a good thing.If they could so easily fly Kong, why would they choose to take him via water, where Godzilla is??What was the main bad guys aim, in building Mechagodzilla??It was a popcorn movie, I knew this going in, so I wasn't expecting high art, but damn it let me down. I know I sound like I hate it, I don't, it looked great and I did enjoy the fighting scenes, they were great, but I was let down."}, {"reviewer_name": "xxxxxdarkmoon", "date": "16 May 2021", "text": "The visual effects are stunning, I think the CGI is the best I have ever seen.

I happily abandon the the rubber-suited actors of my childhood for these CGI marvels.Bit it is a pretty awful movie, really. The acting is ok, but they really aren't given that much to work with in terms of script or story; I'm guessing they were at least paid well-enough that they won't be disappointed at the lack of any Academy Award nominations.

(Spoiler) When Mecha-Godzilla arrives on the scene it is gigantic, it throws Godzilla around like a rag doll and Godzilla doesn't get a single blow or defensive move in. It's not until Kong returns and kicks it's butt that Godzilla is saved.Surely it should of been a toe to toe epic even battle between Godzilla and Mecha that was swung into Godzilla's favour with some help from Kong?Anyway 7 out of 10 is pretty good, gave the previous one 8."}, {"reviewer_name": "rtzteenot", "date": "1 May 2021", "text": "Actually, I think it deserves more.

Seriously. Kong turns into Kratos. Mechagodzilla is just something out of Terminator: Salvation. Godzilla is still boring. Whatever. But this movie is so funny. I see it get praise for the 'epic' combat despite the incredibly lackluster story, and I wholeheartedly disagree. The action was stupid an laughable, and so was the story and the characters. But that's not necessarily a bad thing. Well, I guess it is, but not in this case. I laughed so hard so many times at this movie. The dialogue, story events, and action are all so stupid. The problem with the 2014 Godzilla and King of the Monsters is that they're just so boring. Action is incredibly slow-paced and stories are incredibly bland. They're both bad movies. But Kong: Skull Island is a lot of fun, because the characters and story are somewhat interesting, and the combat is entertaining and done well. It is not in this movie. Kong has an axe that Godzilla shoots his laser beam of death at to charge up. Oh my god. Mechagodzilla still isn't cool, and never will be. And I think the problem with these movies is that Godzilla just isn't cool. He's so slow and boring to watch. Kong isn't necessarily cool either, but at least it's entertaining. The fight scenes in this movie are so bad. And they really want to remind you that Millie Bobby Brown is indeed in the movie. At least in the last one, she had something to do. She's just... here now. Honestly, this movie kind of sucks, but it is definitely worth a watch."}, {"reviewer_name": "david_rudy_lee", "date": "13 April 2021", "text": "This was a movie that I was really excited to hear was being made. Now I knew it was coming from the Easter eggs in the movies before it, but having seen some movies in other attempted cinematic universes, you never know. This one also got caught in the push back of dates with the COVID pandemic as well. I actually got to see this in this theater, which I haven't been able to go to as often as I used to. The synopsis here is natural rivals, the fearsome Godzilla and the might Kong face off, with humanity caught in the balance.We start this movie off with headlines that get us up to speed with the events of the previous movies Godzilla is the alpha titan in our world. To protect another one, King Kong, he is being held on Skull Island in a containment center. Studying him is Ilene Andrews (Rebecca Hall). Helping her is Jia (Kaylee Hottle) who is an orphan from the island. It appears that she might be friendly with the giant gorilla, but he is upset about how he is being held.In Florida, we follow Bernie Hayes (Brian Tyree Henry) as he goes into work at Apex. He has a podcast where he keeps his identity hidden and he knows this corporation is up to something with titans. Today he is making a risky decision to steal data to hopefully blow the top of it off. Godzilla has other plans. He attacks this facility. In his escape, Bernie finds a mechanical eye, but he doesn't have a lot of time to investigate it. Godzilla is also made to be the villain due to this and Monarch, the group that watches them, believes this giant creature is now their enemy.The CEO of Apex is Walter Simmons (Demi\u00e1n Bichir). Along with his associate of Ren Serizawa (Shun Oguri), they go to visit Nathan Lind (Alexander Skarsg\u00e5rd). Him and his brother believe in the hollow Earth theory. His brother died trying to enter one of the theoretical tunnels there due to an extreme gravity shift. Nathan also believes that all of the titans are from there as well. The reason for the visit, Walter believes he's created a high-tech machine that can make the journey. They want Nathan to lead the exploration mission. In order to make it though, he needs a titan.Nathan actually has a relationship with Ilene. It appears to be rocky though. He does convince her to allow them to use Kong to help find their way in. The problem is that if they remove him from this containment habitat, Godzilla will see this as him vying to be the alpha and there can only be one. Walter doesn't have the best intentions. He believes there is a power source down there. What he needs it for actually, could be the cause of power becoming unbalanced and agitating Godzilla.Now I believe that is where I'm going to leave my recap for this movie as it gets you up to speed with what you need to know without spoiling this. Where I want to go next would be that I'm surprised by the continuity here. This feels like it picks up right where Godzilla: King of the Monsters left off and then incorporating in elements from Kong: Skull Island even though that movie took place in the past. That was strategic to allow King Kong to fully grow into his size. There is also a lot of wiggle room time wise there as well.This movie is interesting with how much we focused on Monarch in the previous one. I don't recall if Apex was a company that has been referenced or not, but I do think there's an interesting thing with the name. The Apex being the highest point and this is supposed to be one of the leading companies for technology. There is a dual meaning here with what they're doing secretively and I think that is an interesting nod as well as reveal for it. Walter Simmons is great as the head of this company as well. He seems like he's a nice guy, but there's just something not quite right about him as well.What I also like with this story is continuing to build on the mythology. I like that they've shown us in previous movies that Godzilla and King Kong are long time enemies. This movie is interesting though that it is incorporating the conspiracy theory of the hollow Earth. We actually see this place in the movie. There is a bit off with the physics, but I don't know enough to disprove it. I do like how it continues to build on the lore there. This actually feels a lot like what we got in Godzilla: King of the Monsters with seeing that temple he goes back to when he needs to rest. It just continues to deepen this mythology and I'm a sucker for that.There was something in the movie that I wasn't the biggest fan of. King Kong discovers something that made it feel like we are shifting to the Marvel or DC universe. Now where I'm more accepting of things like this in those, what really works for this Monsterverse is that they've grounded it in reality for as much as you can with kaijus destroying cities and battling it out on Earth. This weapon that King Kong finds, although makes for some cool battle sequences and levels the playing field a bit, I didn't like it. That is really my only major gripe with the movie to be honest.Moving away from the story, I want to next go to what everyone knows about these movies. They are giant CGI fest and to be honest, I thought it looked great. I didn't have any issues with what they did. With the budget used, I think the details of Godzilla looks great. I'm still a fan of the approach they have to allow him to walk on his hind legs. I'm not as in love with King Kong's look, but I don't have any major issues there. They do well in the pacing to give us battle sequences or attack scenes. It isn't an all-out battle, but I think with how deep they go with the story and characters, it has a good balance. We also get some minor giant creatures that I liked and there is a third major character as well. I won't spoil it even though it was spoiled for me. It still didn't ruin anything there. I did want to give a shout out that Adam Wingard directed this. Horror film fans know him and I think he did a great job with the cinematography overall.I've already start to move into this, so I will go to the acting. I find the story of this movie to be interesting. Skarsg\u00e5rd is an underrated actor to me. He is good looking and I think people overlook his acting abilities because of it. He plays this reserved guy very well here. Millie Bobby Brown is solid as his rambunctious young woman. She continued to build on where she was in the previous movie. There is also a solid mirror of her with Hottle. I like that where Madison feels kinship to Godzilla, Jia has this with King Kong. I liked the addition of Hall. Henry brings some good comedy and investigation to his role. Oguri, Eiza Gonz\u00e1lez, Lance Reddick, Kyle Chandler, Bichir, and the rest of the cast also rounded this out for what was needed. I do like the personality that we also get with King Kong, Godzilla and the other large creatures in the movie as well, but most the prominent two.Then really the last thing that I wanted to go into would be the soundtrack. I absolutely love that this movie is taking classic songs from the series and using them here. I really noticed a Godzilla one when him and King Kong first face-off in the ocean. Aside from those tracks that I recognized, the rest of the soundtrack fit for what needed in building up the feel that they're going for. I really dug what they were doing for sure. The creature calls and sound design also helped to bring a sense of realism on top of that.In conclusion here, I really like what they did with this movie. I tried to temper my expectations, but I think this one lived up to what I wanted. The mythology they've introduced helps to set the stage and they continue to build on it. I like incorporating conspiracy theories here to help deepen the story. The story around the kaijus works for me to help bridge the really good battle sequences. The CGI looks amazing to be honest. I like what they did with the soundtrack and sound design. I really just had a gripe with one aspect that takes some of the realism for me. Regardless, this was a really good movie. This is another I will watch before the end of the year to see where I stand with it as well.My Rating: 8.5 out of 10"}, {"reviewer_name": "nakenergy-78627", "date": "8 April 2021", "text": "Thanks HBOMAX streamed this nonsense.

Wingard decided to keep the story simple, with a solid pace, and really focused on making entertaining action sequences, which paid off to a certain extent. With this film being loaded with fun action sequences, the story ran a little shallow, having some predictablities, while having some scenes feel a little far fetched and out context. Where a story runs flat, the characters should compensate for it, but the characters were pretty hallow here, besides Rebecca Hall, and Kaylee Hottle's characters. The other side characters served their purpose, while having their own personalities, but they weren't given much depth at all. Wingard let the monsters take the lead, which worked, but spending so much time with the human characters, and cheesy villain, made the film feel like two different movies.I'm with the minority on this one when I say that I didn't find the CGI to be breathtaking like everyone is saying. I thought for the most part, everything looked very good, but there were some shots where it looked a little over saturated, and cartoonish. I'm also with the minority when I say I wasn't a huge fan of the score, while I feel like it was also overused at times. It was fine for what it was, but I feel like I've heard similar scores, on multiple occasions.Overall, I definitely had fun with this flick, but probably not as much as a lot of other people.

There's a plot. It's contrived and doesn't add up at all. Not that we cared.The big problem here is the humans they tried to make a plot around. It's the typical Hollywood wokeness. Our old \"dad\" scientist is back for a few moments and of course doesn't listen to his young daughter - who is clearly the brilliant Godzilla expert. He comes off as a blind moron with the intelligence of a two year old. If only dads would listen to their teen-aged kids about life lessons and critical thinking more often, eh?Another good doctor fills the role of the 'modern man' who is scared, weak, over-classed and out-matched by every woman around him, naturally. He's scared of Kong but of course, and the women mock him and quite literally call him a coward (even the little girl). Naturally this is okay when the man's involved but somehow if the opposite were done it'd be called misogyny. Go figure. All the women run the show, the only truly strong men are evil, or the Titans themselves - funny that. The only thing approaching a strong male is the black Podcast \"scientist\" who they play off as something of a crazy, fringe, nutjob who lives up to all the conspiracy theories.If the director/writer of this movie actually just tried to make it about the monsters (like the original was) without all of the blue checkboxes being marked off, it'd be a really, really good movie.

I didn't have unreasonable expectations. I was just looking forward to a fun flick Wednesday morning, and happily avoiding work to sit, watch, and enjoy this.Sadly I have to tell you there is NOTHING about this that's a 10, or a 9, or even an 8, beyond maybe some technical things (Sound, maybe? I don't know, I wasn't watching it for the sound quality.).So if it's not an 8, why didn't I give it a 7...?I actually stopped the action twice, it was so boring.So why not a 6?Because the fight sequences were dull, just action. The monsters fought like men in rubber suits. Awkward and without any depth of character. I found myself thinking that even with CGI, filmmakers need to have choreography. Then I realized that of course the fights were choreographed. One little bit actually looked like a rubber suit scene, and it was neat for that second, but that's not what this was about. And a moment's homage, or the several various homages throughout the film, do NOT make a great movie.It was the lack of any decent plot point that brought it down from a 5 to a 4.In fact, plot points were completely wasted.SPOILERS: MID WAY through the movie Godzilla and Kong fight, and Kong LOSES! So that's that, and you're only mid way through! But they set up for a second fight, but ...right before the second fight Godzilla does something so amazing that you realize Godzilla HAS to win. So the second fight is pointless going into it. And what did Godzilla do that was so amazing? He blasts a hole all the way through to the center of the Earth, to attack King Kong. And when Kong dives into the hole to emerge on the surface of the Earth, is Godzilla waiting for his mortal enemy...? NO! Godzilla is standing off to the side, looking at a building, ...maybe relieving himself? (IDK).There is a long list of plot points that SHOULD have been addressed in script form, but obviously weren't: Kong is being carefully guarded, but no one has noticed he's having sign language conversations with a little girl. Early on a daughter explains to her father EXACTLY what's happening, but the adult doesn't listen to his child, and apparently although he's the expert in charge he is also so stupid as to not have thought of the simple explanation himself."}, {"reviewer_name": "a-h-schramm-584-299867", "date": "30 March 2021", "text": "I loved Monster / Kaiju flicks ever since I saw my first one as a little kid.

Yet eiza was part of the top credits, REALLY MISLEADING (AGAIN) That was an idiotic move. Seriously, even minor characters such as eiza's (also counting jetta of jem & the holograms, darling of baby driver, carlala of welcome to marwen, nyssiana of alita: battle angel & madam M of Hobbs & Shaw) deserve more then a split second of screentime & deserve to get to know better then that.

Traumatized, roughed up & later deal with the consequences, her dad & company had made, ok.

The soundtrack is odd, and when they get to Hong Kong, it turns into 'Tron' - including the lighting of the buildings. Not sure why... Some good CGI, with what I imagine a Komodo Dragon fighting a gorilla might be like in real life. A few laugh-out-loud moments and oddly you end up empathizing with Kong as a fellow mammal. Needless to say, I'm sure further sequels will follow."}, {"reviewer_name": "saikatsamanta", "date": "5 April 2021", "text": "All the previous Monsterverse films have been very average for me. They had cool action sequences but the story & characters were dreadfully written. The last Godzilla film had such bad dialogues & insufferable characters that I even lost interest in the epic Fight Scenes. But surprisingly this one is quite entertaining as the writing has improved. The characters are likeable & they gave Kong an emotional depth in his storyline with the little deaf girl who was brilliant.

It's definitely huge on the big budget special effects and CGI, but I had the sense there was something missing to make it truly epic. When Mechagodzilla was introduced I was slightly bummed, knowing that the attention would shift away a bit from the title's mighty Titans and have to deal with the creation of the Apex Cybernetlcs CEO, Walter Simmons (Demi\u00e1n Bichir). With Mechagodzilla whipping Godzilla around like a rag doll, it didn't say much for the superiority of the King of the Monsters, later reinforced when Kong pulled Mecha's head off with it's spine trailing, reminiscent of the giant ape in the 2005 \"King Kong\" remake by Peter Jackson. My favorite laugh out loud moment in the picture occurred when Nathan Lind (Alexander Skarsg\u00e5rd) used one of those 'hollow Earth aerial vehicles' like a defibrillator to jump start Kong's heart to get him ready for the trip to Hong Kong. That was just too funny. All in all, a very much to be expected large scale spectacle to see on the big screen, but don't fool yourself into thinking that \"Godzilla vs . Kong\" implies a winner.

Highly recommended."}, {"reviewer_name": "MovieWarfare", "date": "4 April 2021", "text": "The movie that the entire Monsterverse was building up towards has come out. The premise is \"Kong and his protectors undertake a perilous journey to find his true home. Along for the ride is Jia, an orphaned girl who has a unique and powerful bond with the mighty beast. However, they soon find themselves in the path of an enraged Godzilla as he cuts a swath of destruction across the globe. The initial confrontation between the two titans -- instigated by unseen forces -- is only the beginning of the mystery that lies deep within the core of the planet\". So does it live up to the massive hype or fails to deliver?Firstly, the fight scenes between the two titular characters are amazing. The director, Adam Windgard succeeds in giving an epic brawl between the two and showing their distinct fighting styles. Godzilla has this brutal, animalistic and force of nature style that just demolishes everything compared to Kong's more cunning and agile is just a sight to behold. The fight scenes are some of the best in the series so far, without a doubt. What's even better is that there are fights that are actually in the daytime! The two previous Godzilla movies mostly had fights that were at nighttime in the rain with minimal light. Here there are daytime fights where every action is completely visible. While there are still some fights at night, the lighting is significantly better so even the nighttime fights are improved. Additionally, there is a clear winner between the two which is quite surprising.The CGI is also still incredibly impressive with the two titular characters looking better than ever. The score by Junkie XL is also great as it makes the action scenes feel more exciting. Although, his work here isn't as great as say Mad Max Fury Road or Zack Snyder's Justice League but it still does a fairly good job. There are also some visually great shots by cinematographer Ben Seresin that illustrates the grand nature of Godzilla and Kong. Although, none of the shots is as gorgeous as in Godzilla: King of the Monsters but it still works for the movie.One problem I did have with Godzilla: King of the Monsters was that the focus was too much on the human characters. Godzilla vs Kong rectifies this to an extent by having Kong's journey be the focus with the humans along for the ride. Another thing that was fixed is the runtime. It is under 2 hours, so I never got overly bored at points like in the previous Monsterverse movie. The pacing is just right and by the end, I felt satisfied. There is also a great relationship shown throughout between Jia (Kaylee Hottle), a young and mute orphan, who has a special bond with Kong. It's actually quite heart-warming to watch and gives Kong some more depth and personality. Ironically, Jia is the best human character so far in the series and she can't talk.However, the same can't be said about the other human characters. Dr Nathan Lind (Alexander Skarsg\u00e5rd) is just the typical reluctant hero character and nothing more than that. Dr Ilene Andrews (Rebecca Hall) is just a Kong exposition lady. Bernie Haye (Brian Tyree Henry) is comic relief 1 and Josh Valentine (Julian Dennison) is comic relief 2. Madison Russell (Millie Bobby Brown) and Dr Mark Russell (Kyle Chandler) return from Godzilla: King of the Monsters without any improvement in their characters with Mark's character arc from that movie being tossed out of the window here. Walter Simmons (Demi\u00e1n Bichir) is a typical evil CEO and Maia Simmons (Eiza Gonz\u00e1lez) is just evil henchmen.There is also a giant waste of a potentially interesting character in Ren Serizawa (Shun Ogori) who is the son of the \"Let them fight\" guy from the previous Godzilla movies. While the \"Let them fight\" guy love the Titans and wanted to coexist with them, Ren is working on the opposite side that is trying to wipe them out. Why is he trying to wipe the monsters? Why did he not follow in his father's footstep? What was his relationship with his father? How did he feel about his father's death? The movie does not elaborate whatsoever on his character even though there is potentially an interesting idea here. Instead, he is only used to be name-dropped so that some people can go \"oh he has the same name as let them fight guy\" and fulfil one plot point.Overall, Godzilla vs Kong delivers on a thrilling brawl between the titular characters. It is still unfortunate that none of the Monsterverse movies can provide compelling human characters where the stones are there. However, the director clearly understands the audience and what they desire. He doesn't insert an abundance of human drama or overly complicated plot threads. He gives the audience exactly what they want and that is a big lizard fighting a big monkey, and it is phenomenal."}, {"reviewer_name": "m_o_r_2", "date": "3 April 2021", "text": "The plot and storyline is not perfect.

It is a mindless thrill ride which will be guaranteed to entertain you throughout its 1hr53min runtime. It throws away the pointless human story tropes from the first two movies which in my opinion made them a flop. This movie knows what it is and acts upon it. When the action begins you will enjoy it.

Anyway, Happy 32nd birthday to me! I knew I had to celebrate it by seeing the most anticipated movie of the year (at least for now). This movie features Godzilla well, attacking people for no reason when he was the hero in the 2014 Godzilla movie (the only one in the MonsterVerse I saw). They recruit King Kong to stop Godzilla and to get him home, which happens to be the center of the Earth. These are the most visually dazzling parts of the movie, as we see this giant creative world in the center of the Earth for Kong and his ancestors to live.The story's not over as Kong has to fight Godzilla again, and it's revealed that Godzilla was being provoked by a company named Apex, who was working on Mechagodzilla, a giant robotic Godzilla to be used in case Godzilla went rogue. Mechagodzilla itself has gone rogue and Godzilla and Kong have to team up to stop it. The final battle is easily the best scene (agreed to by my whole family in the theater) as Kong uses a mystical axe to take down Mechagodzilla. In the end, Godzilla seemed to defeat Kong, but since it was Kong who slayed Mechagodzilla, they both won! It has plenty of action to spare, but doesn't forget to show off amazing environments and it's easily the best \"Vs\" crossover movie I've ever seen. Godzilla and Kong both have distinct personalities and while you may not remember the human characters, it's definitely worth watching. ***"}, {"reviewer_name": "sahebabdullah", "date": "23 May 2021", "text": "Big budget movie but it turns out to be strictly average."}, {"reviewer_name": "kmjnhh123", "date": "21 May 2021", "text": "So before i go into detail about this review i knew exactly from the get go that they would not kill off one of them, it was so obvious, of course they wouldn't because of money in the franchise, later down the line they may actually do that but not anytime soon, also looking at the trailer & seeing Mecca Godzilla on the trailer was a instant give-away that Godzilla & Kong would have to team up to defeat Mecca Godzilla. These 2 points alone sum up the movie.Anyway time for detailFirst off as always with these type of films you MUST watch in a iMAX screen or equivalent big screen (Subject to Covid -_-), the CGi was incredible, really well done as last time in King Of Monsters.The film is effectively set in 2 parts, you have big awesome monsters fighting each other; then human parts that try to make a story, now we all know the past \"Story\" elements from the previous films hasn't been the best in terms of hard hitting scenes, but at the same time we cant have a solid 2 hours of monsters fighting. The human bits in this film are better than KOM but it still flys through many things that really needed more explaining, but hey; we are all here to watch big monsters fight, so the human parts you won't remember at all.Now for the monsters, Godzilla & Kong fight through out the film which was good but then it leads to the final bit with Mecca Godzilla, now at this point Kong is almost K/O & Godzilla is losing against Mecca Godzilla, but of course the humans revive Kong & they team up against the unfortunately underwhelming Mecca G. Mecca G seemed like a absolute TANK of a machine at first literally almost killing Godzilla, but then along comes Kong & seems to make Mecca G seem a lot weaker. The end fight wasn't that long at all & i so wanted more of it, i wish it really showed the true power of Mecca G & making Mecca G really hurt Kong & Godzilla.I would of loved to see Mecca G with both Kong & Godzilla on the floor, the humans shooting everything at it as it just stands there with its devil look while everything seems at a lost, then the humans EMP Mecca G giving Kong & Godzilla a chance to get up & then absolutely destroy Mecca G to oblivion. I think that would of been better.The films end so abruptly it annoyed me, after Kong & Godzilla defeat Mecca G, Godzilla literally disappears into the sea within seconds, then it shows Kong in the hollow earth area as his home then the film ends..... thats it.Overall the humans parts were bland as usual, great monster fights although i wish the ending was different along with the ending battle being better but i do think King Of Monsters was much better in terms of awe factor, Ghidorah just hits much harder than this film does.Age - 27Cinema: Cineworld Stevenage iMAX 2D (Unlimited Card)Watch, Avoid, Consider: Watch simply for monsters fighting."}, {"reviewer_name": "BabyJ88", "date": "21 May 2021", "text": "I liked it.

Sure, the characters are as cookie-cutter as they come, the plot is wafer thin and the pacing predictable, but this really shouldn't matter: this is a return to the 'Monsterverse' of our youth, where we imagined Godzilla punching Kong in the streets of Manhattan without nary a worry for the impending insurance claims or impact on the local bird population.Godzilla vs. Kong is Will Smith punching an alien in Independence Day, not Frances McDormand in Nomadland, and cinema has room for both facets of the medium - a fact too many forget to their detriment.Sometimes, we need big, dumb blockbusters to escape our big, dumb world.

The Hollow World scenes are mesmerizing and smartly, from his POV, with the humans actually being great to root for too Fantastic sequence.The Bad: I feel like people always say, \"all I care about are the monsters and the fighting!\" To an extent, it's true, but this movie makes you realize how, yes, even in a movie like this, the human elements matter. The entire Millie Bobby Brown plot is completely unnecessary; it's supposed to be comic relief but it's entirely unfunny. I feel like the only reason those three people are here is to have vaguely recognizable faces. To be honest, almost all of the \"human actors\" and their storylines are pretty weak. I feel like the filmmakers felt that the humans were a problem to be solved, not a part of the story.The Ugly: I'm still not a fan of how Godzilla looks; his face is completely indistinguishable at times. While this is definitely more of a King Kong movie (as I expected), I would have liked the Big Guy to be on screen more."}, {"reviewer_name": "itzsammy", "date": "7 May 2021", "text": "This movie was okay and probably better than the two godzilla movies released before, I loved the visual effects and sound effects produced by the creative team.

Who would win in a gladiator deathmatch: Godzilla or King Kong? In one corner stands a prehistoric sea monster covered in impenetrable scales and the ability of atomic breath. In the other corner is a 337-foot-tall gorilla that has battled dinosaurs and other monsters on his home of Skull Island.This battle is a part of the MonserVerse Cinematic Universe and has been three films in the making with 2014's \"Godzilla\" kicking things off. After that came Kong's introduction in 2017 with \"Kong: Skull Island\". And then in 2019, it was time for Godzilla to show off once again in \"Godzilla: King of the Monsters\".But why are King Kong and Godzilla fighting each other? The answer lies in the hands of an evil tech billionaire (it always does). Walter Simmons, president of the ironically named Apex Cybernetics, is hunting for the glory of being the man who protected the world from these titans. Like Lex Luthor's plan in \"Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice'', Simmons wants to pit the two titans against each other, and hopefully have one kill the other in the process. A few other side plots and revelations come up to the surface (literally), but I'll avoid that for the sake of spoilers.Director Adam Wingard has heard your complaints about the previous two Godzilla movies. Unlike Godzilla being kept away from the spotlight like in 2014, he's in full daylight wreaking havoc for all to see. The visual effects and sound work are quite gorgeous as we are awestruck by the might of this god-like creature. The experience can only get better as the screen gets bigger. Composer Tom Holkenborg, incorporating the world's largest bass drum, provides another epic score just as he did a few weeks ago in \"Zack Snyder's Justice League\".And instead of the human characters getting the large majority of the screen time like in 2019, their storylines have been drastically reduced to allow for a more condensed runtime that favors fists over words.Wingard does give those fists some dramatic weight as he takes a page out of Peter Jackson's playbook that was used in the 2005 King Kong film. Kong is the most developed character here as he is given a new way to express himself through sign language. Wingard also gives us several close-up shots of Kong's face, which looks incredible. Despite being as tall as a skyscraper, Kong isn't so different from you or me. He just wants to return to his home and figure out if there are any other super monkeys like him.The trimming of the humans does come with a price as no character is given enough development to become memorable, and some just become unbearable. The humans merely only exist to dump exposition and reveal enough information to keep the plot moving at a reasonable clip.But this problem is the lesser of two evils as I (and I'm assuming you) didn't go into this movie expecting Ingmar Bergman-level human drama. I came into this movie to see a giant ape punch a giant lizard in the face, and the movie more than delivers on that promise.For all you betting fans, there is a clear winner in this versus matchup. Obviously, I can't tell you who wins, even though the outcome will already be public knowledge by the time this review comes out. The camera whips and pans around as we are given front-row seats to this matchup. It reminds one of the \"Rocky\" movies as our prizefighters duke it out with uppercuts, haymakers, and a flurry of combos. It's gloriously over-the-top as Hong Kong acts as the boxing ring.The previous Godzilla movies tried to push the idea of the collateral damage caused by these titans, similar to how Superman was treated after beating Zod in \"Man of Steel\". Wingard throws that idea out the window as he has his monsters push each other through buildings and use the environment to their advantage. The casualty rate for this fight has to be in the millions, but that thought never comes across in the movie or your head.\"Godzilla vs. Kong\" is ludicrously stupid and silly in just the right way. The humans may be boring and forgettable, but that's to be expected in a movie where the main attraction is an ape fighting a lizard. Find the biggest screen you possibly can to see this, as it deserves the full attention of all your senses."}, {"reviewer_name": "xiaohei-80112", "date": "18 April 2021", "text": "Dissapointed by last time few movies on king Kong and Godzilla but this is great!like the fighting parts very much.

Kong listens to essential and intelligent Kong, not to humans. And Kong certainly does not do the bidding of humans or will be told a human threat, not the threat that wiped him out, is the real threat. Kong should have figured it out, he should not have been told.The Kong Axe was ridiculous, and only would have been better if Kong had made it showcasing the language intelligence he displayed. Kong's natural abilities should have been showcased and his intelligence was wasted by letting an axe stand in for it. Godzilla came off as a bully (I get he is an elemental /fundamental force) and I wanted to see Kong (less of an elemental force due to intelligence and the ability to exercise self-control) take him down a few pegs. Too bad lightening or another natural occurring element did not make him naturally stronger, tougher, and faster.When Kong becomes a better, empowered, more ferocious, and stronger monster I'll consider other movies.

Though I got that people believed that they wanted more giant monster fights, for me, those then provided by the sequel were boring, like watching two skyscrapers slowly bang into each other. Fortunately, I feel like \"Godzilla vs. Kong\" solves the problem by having better and more dynamic choreography.A businessman and philanthropist, Walter Simmons (Demian Bichir) is interested in a power source he believes is located under the Earth surface in a substratum where the Titan's appear to have originally come from. Believing that it will take a Titan to locate it, the giant Ape Kong is drugged and taken on an expedition to Antarctica. In leaving Skull Island though, his existence is revealed to Godzilla, who needs to prove his dominance on this world and goes after his new rival.I mean, don't get me wrong - this is all pretty silly stuff. With hokum about a hollow Earth that doesn't really make much sense (even less when we're actually down there). But chances are, you're not really here for the plot, you're here for the fighting between the two titans and mostly that's really well done. The visually effects are top notch and the greater manoeuvrability of Kong, relative to the Titans we've seen before, helps make the fights a lot more interesting. (Even if, plot wise, it's a virtual retread of the beats from \"King of The Monsters\".)The human characters are fine, if similarly, as interchangeable as they always have been. Millie Bobby Brown returns, as does Kyle Chandler. Rebecca Hall takes on the scientist role that gets passed around, but she does have some chemistry with Alexander Skarsgard. Brian Tyree Henry is probably the liveliest addition, playing conspiracy podcaster turned reluctant adventurer Bernie Hayes.This feels like the culmination of the Monsterverse to me, I don't think there's another character with enough clout that they could add to the mix to make it worthwhile, Cloverfield maybe?!?.

These concepts now seem to have been given to a caffeinated child with a video game addiction.Strip out the A+ special effects in GvK and you're basically watching a boring sequence of \"character development\" cut scenes between epic boss battle sequences. They failed to make me care about any of the characters, human or otherwise. This movie is lazy and hopes that we really care that so-and-so is a friend or son or cousin or spent time with one of characters in the past movies.They probably had to cut a LOT of content to make the \"surprise special boss\" character work without it being a three-hour slog. It doesn't help the world-building at ALL though.Worth exactly ONE watch."}, {"reviewer_name": "zardoz-13", "date": "13 April 2021", "text": "Anybody who enjoys \"Godzilla\" movies should crave director Adam Wingard's \"Godzilla vs. Kong,\" a bizarre, sci-fi, fantasy that pits the eponymous Titans against each other for their second historic cinematic showdown. Initially, in 1962, these adversaries clashed in Japanese director Ishir\u00f4 Honda's \"King Kong Vs. Godzilla\" but neither opponent could claim victory. Contrived as Wingard's \"Godzilla\" entry is in the Warner Brothers/Legendary Pictures' Monsterverse franchise, \"G vs. K\" doesn't end in a stalemate! Remember, death isn't perpetual in sci-fi as Hollywood has shown us. Writers Eric Pearson of \"Thor: Ragnarok\" and Max Borenstein of \"Godzilla\" (2014) have whipped up a super-sized smackdown with several surprises based on a story by Terry Rossio of \"Godzilla\" (1998) and Michael Dougherty & Zach Shields of \"Godzilla, King of the Monsters\" (2019). Of course, the ideal spectator will eagerly embrace this nonsense with nothing short of enthusiasm, no matter how staggering its outlandish shenanigans are. Moreover, the global arena for this PG-13 epic gives these opponents more than enough elbow room. Wingard and his scribes spout Hollow Earth theory when the two Titans aren't clashing in gladiatorial creature feature violence. Seven minutes shy of two hours, this \"Godzilla\" installment introduces another fabled monster from the Japanese Toho franchise as well as a newbie from the Warner Brothers/Legendary Monsterverse. Unlike the WB's first \"Godzilla\" (2014) where shadows shrouded the king-sized kaiju during his nocturnal depredations, \"G vs. K\" has the terrible twosome tangling in broad daylight for maximum impact. The roving sea battle and the horrendous battle royal in downtown Hong Kong are splendidly orchestrated without any inclement weather obscuring the view.\"Godzilla vs. Kong\" unfolds on Skull Island where the huge ape resides in idyllic splendor, perhaps a little too idyllic. Uprooting a tree, Kong strips away its branches and then hurls it like a javelin into the sky. Surprise of surprises, this crudely fashioned lance impales itself improbably in the heavens to reveal the presence of an immense bio-dome. The lance shattered some of the panels, like a brick smashing a plate-glass window. Kong has been confined within this colossal enclosure for his own safety. He is in the same predicament Jim Carrey faced in \"The Truman Show\" (1998). Basically, Monarch has designed the bio-dome to protect him from his sworn enemy Godzilla. Updating the Kong legend, the writers reveal Kong and Godzilla have been foes since the dawn of history. Allusions to their rivalry appear in many sacred ancient texts of dead civilizations. An anthropologist, Ilene Andrews (Rebecca Hall of \"The Town\"), has spent ten years on Skull Island studying Kong. A deaf, indigenous, young native girl, Jia (newcomer Kaylee Hottle), rescued by Kong after a cataclysmic storm wiped out all the natives, lives with Andrews now. Jia uses sign language to communicate with Kong, but she hasn't told Andrews that they understand each other.Meantime, sinister Apex Cybernetics Corp. Founder & CEO Walter Simmons (Demi\u00e1n Bichir of \"Lowriders\") approaches a disgraced geologist, Dr. Nathan Lind (Alexander Skarsg\u00e5rd of \"Straw Dogs\"), who has published a book about Hollow Earth Theory. Simmons recruits Lind to comb those subterranean realms for an energy source which mankind can use to thwart Godzilla's future depredations. What better guide than King Kong to escort Lind and company through those provinces? Kong trusts only Jia, and Jia assures Kong that his ancestors hailed from Hollow Earth. The opening to the fabled land lies via an icy portal in Antarctica. Meantime, Godzilla wreaks havoc when the kaiju raids an Apex lab at its Pensacola, Florida, facility in an apparently unprovoked attack. Discretion prevents me from revealing the real reason behind Godzilla's attack because it would ruin a major revelation. In another subplot, conspiracy theory podcaster Bernie Hayes (Brian Tyree Henry of \"White Boy Rick\"), who works for Apex, has been biding his time before he blows the whistle on Simmons. Madison Russell (Millie Bobby Brown of \"Godzilla, King of the Monsters\") and her geeky computer bud Josh (Julian Dennsion of \"Deadpool 2\") join Bernie. Our heroes are horrified when they discover Apex has been incubating those hideous Skull Island Skullcrawlers at its Pensacola plant. No, Godzilla didn't raid the facility simply to annihilate the Skullcrawlers.The voyage to Antarctica finds a restless Kong shackled to the deck of a ship and later hoisted aloft by helicopters. Initially, an armada of U. S. Navy warships provide an escort for Kong. Since he is no longer entombed on Skull Island, Kong finds himself at the mercy of Godzilla. Those wicked dorsal fins ripple the surface of the ocean as Godzilla ploughs a path through the phalanx of ships, sinking some along the way on a collision course for Kong. Indeed, it looks like curtains for Kong. Happily, somebody removes Kong's giant shackles, and the two gargantuans generate a typhoon of terror. This briny blue brawl constitutes little more than a warm-up act, but Godzilla fans will shadow box with each blow they swap. One classic moment has Kong clobbering Godzilla with a spectacular right cross.If you're counting the films in the WB/Legendary Pictures' Monsterverse, \"Godzilla vs. Kong\" qualifies as the fourth. The Monsterverse doesn't observe chronological order. Garth Edwards' \"Godzilla\" (2014) emerged first and tagged the monsters as Massive Unidentified Terrestrial Organisms, a.k.a. MUTOs or Titans. \"Kong: Skull Island\" (2017), the \"Godzilla\" sequel/prequel spanning World War II to 1973, bowed second. In \"Kong: Skull Island,\" President Truman created the ultra-secret government agency Monarch to maintain tabs on the MUTOs. Basically, Monarch runs through the franchise like a thread. \"Godzilla, King of the Monsters\" (2019) picked up after \"Godzilla,\" and \"Godzilla vs. Kong\" follows in the aftermath. Mankind's obligatory meddling with nature triggers far-reaching complications. Essentially, the Monarch vs. Apex rivalry separates good humans from evil. The preposterous hocus-pocus that drives this titular showdown takes its cues from the \"Alien\" film franchise with its paranoid corporation. Altogether, \"Godzilla vs. Kong\" surpasses itself when our monstrous rivals put up their dukes and knock each other for loops."}, {"reviewer_name": "lucascanes-11937", "date": "12 April 2021", "text": "There is not much of a plot in Godzilla vs. Kong and most of the movie is special affects and humans constantly interfering with the battle.

It was one of the best trailers we have gotten in a while. It looked like it was going to be exactly what everybody was hoping for, A big dumb monster movie! It completely delivered on its promise. It did have a solid story built up around the fights. The Hollow Earth theory that they have been building up was explained in this film. It was a nice finisher to the four movies because it completed what it promised to complete unlike the recent Star Wars movies. The storyline I didn't find myself enjoying was the one with the kids and the podcaster. It sort of felt like they were there just to explain many things that were happening with the movie. The heart of the movie was in fact Kong. He was almost a character himself. The characters that were protecting him were also people that weren't two dimensional. They didn't really get much backstory but you did see one the characters change over the course of he movie which you didn't get in the last Godzilla movie. As said in the trailers, there was a little girl who had a special bond with Kong. She didn't really grow throughout the movie but she was still a strong pillar to this powerhouse of a movie. This film felt like an old monster movie like Mother Vs Godzilla were in mainly focused on Godzilla because he already got two movies. Kong was the main focus of this film but Godzilla didn't come out looking like he didn't have any clue what was going on in the end. The story surprised to some extent but still is what you would expect in a typical monster flick.The acting in the Godzilla Vs Kong isn't a highlight by far. I have seen almost all of the people in this film in another once before. Everybody did good but I wouldn't say this will be the highlight of anybodies career.The reason why majority of the people saw daylight again to go see this movie was the action. The start had a little bit but most the action was populated at the end of the film and I did think that it started to get a little congested. It was sort of hard to follow all of the action towards the end because there were no breaks in the action. My eyes even started to hurt because I couldn't follow what was going on. It was just too much. Fight scenes need to have breaks or else the human eye won't be able to process what is going on. The bathroom fight scene in Mission Impossible six took a nice amount of breaks same for the Duel Of The Fates at the end of Star Wars Episode One. Even more in the big monster style, the twenty fourteen Godzilla film even had a fair amount of breaks in its big end fight. This film just forgot to do that and I couldn't follow the fight. Besides for that scene, the action was as promised. The start of the film had an outstanding scene with Godzilla just tearing through buildings.Godzilla Vs Kong did in the end, keep its promise with the action but it did feel a little overdone sometimes.

If you're looking for Oscar-worthy performances or writing, you're looking at exactly the wrong place, buddy. This movie is just a thin reason to have these two kaiju icons duke it out in the octagon in a no-holds-barred fight for the title of King.And boy, is it a whole lotta fun.You want brighter-than-the sun-after-you've spent-all-day-indoors, vibrant, eye-popping colors? Come and get 2 hours of it. Someone in the production department bought out all the neon and LEDs they could find and just glued it all over the sets. Hong Kong, where one of the fights take place, is literally drowning in neon, and that's not a bad thing.After a year of barely any blockbusters, Godzilla vs. Kong roars into screens and shows you exactly what we've all been missing: a festival of groundbreaking, rich visual effects. I was trying to spot drops in quality in the CGI, but I struggled to find any.The direction of the all-CGI scenes, especially the action sequences, is also noteworthy: when Kong is knocked down by a thunderous uppercut from Godzilla, the camera direction helps to give the impact a little more oomph.And since it's CGI, director Adam Wingard doesn't have to resort to that style of quick-cuts, thousand-different-takes, lose-all-sense-of-space filmmaking that bogs down the modern action genre ever since Bourne popularized it. In fact, the fights feel fluid without sacrificing the perceived impact that two behemoths throwing punches would give off, precisely because they're a series of longer takes. It's a testament to the direction that you can perfectly sense the weight of these giants' movements, of their punches, kicks, and skyscraper-throwing.Accompanying these brawls are outstanding sound design and orchestral music, which I feel does its job. The score knows when to creep away and when to crank up the volume to 13, but never takes any attention away from the monsters. Both Godzilla's and Kong's roars, screams, and whines are immaculately done. I still get excited inside when I hear Godzilla charging his laserbeam; for me, that sort of whirring noise that continually grows louder has become synonymous with the character. It's also really badass.In fact, if I had to sum up this film in one word, it's just that: Badass."}, {"reviewer_name": "singam-oa", "date": "8 April 2021", "text": "When it comes to a monster movie, we actually don't need plot in this movie.

Godzilla though, its only focus throughout the film is attacking a lab facility in Hong Kong, a key focus of an investigative podcaster, Bernie, wanting to figure out what's being worked on at his former place of employment, Apex Cybernetics. With that, you can already guess that human characters play a role in the movie, both for Godzilla and Kong.In fact, the movie begins with Kong, and it soon establishes that Kong has a connection with a deaf human girl, Jia, but is also trapped in a camouflaged facility against its will. The girl's mother, Ilene, soon clarifies that it was to protect Kong from being hunted down by Godzilla, a problem they'll soon face when trying to relocate Kong by sea (again against its will), as shown on the trailer. Throughout this part of the film, the focus is on Jia and Ilene, and how Jia seems to understand Kong better than anyone else by using sign language, giving Kong human characteristics such as happiness, belonging to a home, sadness, and even doubt. This, in my opinion, is the best monster and human interaction in the whole movie.And Godzilla? We have returning human characters from the previous film, Mark and his daughter, Madison. Noticing that Godzilla was attacking the area around Apex Cybernetics in an out-of-character fashion, Madison knew that Godzilla wouldn't just turn against humans all of a sudden and, being a fan of Bernie... with her dad dismissing him as being nuts, she decided to investigate the matter with some assistance from a supporting character, Josh. What amounts is Josh bribing a shopkeeper to share Bernie's location, the trio breaking into the lab, and discovering the real reason for Godzilla's attacks: the main villain(?), Walter, was constructing Mecha Godzilla as Godzilla's replacement, and has his daughter, Maya, following the Kong crew to Hollow Earth... an area Kong seems to be familiar with, to steal Kong's axe. This is required to supercharge Mecha Godzilla, but this doesn't happen since Maya accidentally provokes Kong, which then kills her off with its palm. In a way, the whole Kong story till this point felt a bit like Disney's \"Atlantis: The Lost Empire.\"Speaking of cartoons, the event that leads to the climax can be described as \"cartoonish.\" Prior, Mecha Godzilla was actually controlled by a human connection via biological supercomputer, or Ghidorah's wired skull basically. However, since this supercomputer was self-learning, Mecha Godzilla gets a mind of its own, fries the human controller, gradually makes its way towards Walter's office at a high elevation, and claws him to death. With that, Mecha Godzilla breaks its way into Hong Kong, picking a fight with Godzilla that just finished off Kong, resulting to more havocs and casualties.I almost forgot to mention that, before Mecha Godzilla shows up in Hong Kong, Godzilla just got done finishing Kong, possibly putting it at risk of cardiac arrest. Another supporting character from the Kong crew, Nathan, actually helps by turning his flying vehicle into an oversized CPR. Earlier in the film, using sign language of course, Jia and Ilene made fun of how \"cowardly\" Nathan was towards Kong, but you barely notice strong proof of this. In fact, he actually turns out to be sympathetic towards, even to the point of risking his life with his oversized CPR, so that Kong may help Godzilla take down Mecha Godzilla. By the end, it feels satisfying to see Jia and Ilene badding Nathan on the back (not literally) for his bravery, after gaining consciousness.In fact, the climax focuses on Kong and Godzilla taking down Mecha Godzilla, and the human characters helping to handicap Mecha Godzilla from the lab. As some people said online, the resulting monster fight is worthy of the big screen. Honestly, this is probably the best part of Godzilla's story, which otherwise focused mainly on sniffing out Mecha Godzilla since the beginning of the film, while occasionally clashing with Kong. By the end of the fight Mecha Godzilla, Godzilla and Kong roar at each other, probably implying mutual understanding between them, and Godzilla makes its way into the sea, parting ways.The climax, honestly I was expecting something better, especially for Godzilla, but I felt like Kong being at home in Hollow Earth with his human friends and family was a good way to end the film."}, {"reviewer_name": "arabnikita", "date": "31 March 2021", "text": "This film delivers exactly what it promised which is two hours of unapologetic action and gargantuan battles between cinema's most iconic monsters. Could it have been better narrative-wise? Definitely. Could the characters have been more fleshed out? Sure. Could it have been any more immersive in terms of sound, visuals and effects? Highly unlikely.In a movie where the protagonists are an ape and a lizard fighting for supremacy, you shouldn't go in expecting intricate dialogue or character depth. You should be expecting monstrous action and here it is spilling over the top. Considering the fact that the outcome of the movie is pretty easy to guess, the story managed to supply a number of elements to keep you engaged prior to the climax. The destruction was next level and the battle city worked well with it's neon lights and tall buildings that were perfect for smashing. Just try not to think about the casualties...From the negatives, the trailer has clearly spilled too many beans and the \"conflict resolution\" felt like it came out of a 90s cartoon. As far a monster blockbusters go, the plot is simple, the battles are heart-pounding and the CGI is granularly detailed to make the titans look as real as possible. Even though it is part 4 of the Monster series, you should be able to connect the limited dots without seeing the previous instalments. Watching this film in IMAX or Dolby is definitely half of the experience due to the bombastic visuals and seat-shaking sound which will be impossible to replicate in a home setting.Movies.shmovies on Instagram for Movie and Tv show revirws."}, {"reviewer_name": "prafulmhapsekar", "date": "30 March 2021", "text": "Watched it twice.....Amazing visual effects and Monster Action."}, {"reviewer_name": "jfcrwdd", "date": "29 March 2021", "text": "Without a doubt, an excellent film with sensational CGI effects, although the human plot lacked a bit of development, leaving some things that happened in Godzilla King of the monsters unfinished, such as what happened to Dr. Chen?

So, Kong is taken away from Skull Island to attain what they want but Godzilla finds Kong and goes to fight him as they share an ancient rivalry.This movie is actually focused on Kong and Godzilla is just in it, but still has a good amount of screen time. The movie delivers exactly what the fans wanted and it was massive enough. The story was predictable and was executed in an okay way. There were some sub plots but, they all were connected to the third act. The action sequences in this movie were definitely the highlight of this and it demands to be seen on the biggest screen possible. Unlike the previous installments, it mostly focuses on the monsters and really watchable and usually don't cut to the humans much. The scale is massive and almost each shot is beautiful to look at. The music was really suiting. This movie thankfully doesn't go into much world building and focuses on the monsters more. Adam also did a good job directing it. The casting was good and some of them had a decent characterization.The pacing is a bit uneven at times. The story could've been better. Some of the characters did require some more characterization. There were enough fight sequences but in the end, it leaves you wanting for more. The first fight between Kong and Godzilla turned out to be a bit disappointment for me but, it got paid off in the last act. The last act is everything the fans were hoping for and that part was really a fun ride.Overall, if you are a fan of these monsters, you'll really have a fun time watching this even though the plot would be really predictable for many. People who just want to see the action sequences would also have a decent time in here. And, those who never liked the previous installments, well, this isn't also for you.

We watched about eighty kaiju movies in the last few weeks and can honestly tell you that every single one of those movies can claim just about the same thing, so the venerable Toho got smart and added aliens and ape humans from the future to those scenes, as well as miniature singing women who worship Mothra so that even the non-giant monster moments of their films are real strange.To those of you not able to name the four different eras of Godzilla films - Showa, Heisei, Millennium and Reiwa - let me tell you, the human moments in this are in no way as bad as All Monsters Attack.That said, you can literally remove Godzilla and every single human from this movie and you still pretty much could have the same story. This isn't Godzilla vs. Kong as much as it's another movie that we could call Kong: Inside the Hollow Earth. Actually, those moments, where Kong and a crew of good and bad scientists goes inside a gravity well to wind up in a Skartaris or Shangri-La or Savage Land inside our planet are some of the best parts of the movie, topped only by Godzilla somehow being able to blast nuclear fire from Hong Kong to the middle of Earth's core without destroying the entire planet.So, if we remove those moments of humanity - there's a whole conspiracy theory plot with Milly Bobby Brown, Brian Tyree Henry and Julian Dennison from Hunt for the Wilderpeople that exists merely to give us exposition, show off some conspiracy theory under the world trains and explain who the big bad really is.Yes, unlike every human bad guy who has ever gone up against a giant monster, it turns out that owning a big company like Apex Cybernetics and using scientific expeditions to make money never really pays off.Director Adam Wingard made You're Next and The Guest. If I hadn't looked up that he directed this, I would have never known. It's a writer's room-made film, with the last creative team making rewrites so that everyone is in character. And it's another part of the shared universe post-Marvel Cinematic Universe aesthetic, where every movie leads to the next, unlike the Toho films where fans were the ones to create a patchwork No-Prize narrative that barely connects them.That said, you can just enjoy the huge set pieces here, like Kong and Godzilla battling on the deck of an aircraft carrier and the final battle in Hong Kong. It looks like paintings come to life, the kind of battle between giant monsters that I could only dream of as a child satisfied with foam suits and zipped-in actors.Ishir\u00f4 Honda, who directed the original King Kong vs. Godzilla and made a movie that satirized Japanese TV along the way, once said \"The reason I showed the monster battle through the prism of a ratings war was to depict the reality of the times. When you think of King Kong just plain fighting Godzilla, it is stupid. But how you stage it, the times in which it takes place, that is the thought process of the filmmaker.\"So is this film dumb? Well, it was sold at some Carl's Jr. Restaurants with Godzilla hamburgers and Kong chicken sandwiches, the exact kind of commercialism that the Toho movie made fun of with Kong yaki noodles. But it is a big tentpole Hollywood movie in the weird second year of there not being a lot of places ready to show it.But hey, it does have monsters named Titanus Warbats and Kong gets a radioactive axe, so I can't be all huffy and say that I didn't enjoy it. I still have an entire shelf full of much better kaiju films - ask me, I'll recommend like twenty to you - to enjoy whenever I want, but today's children need a movie like this to get them excited the same way I was back in 1976, going crazy for Kong in theaters and Godzilla on UHF monster host shows."}, {"reviewer_name": "vforfacade", "date": "3 June 2021", "text": "Godzilla VS Kong (2021) is a movie designed to satisfy the audience with its scale and CGI glory.

So watch out for 'the kiddies.'I've watched this Monsterverse trope thrice and this was set up admirably, IMO, by the latest Kong: Skull Island and the previous Godzilla: King Of the Monsters. In Skull Island several mentions were made of \"Kong still growing\", because a little research will tell you that up until SI, Kong was shorter than Gojira (Japanese) by about forty feet - now they are the same height.The Producers have finally figured that you can't wait for an hour, of a two hour movie, to show the Kaiju's (monsters) and we are treated to a sighting of Kong in the first few minutes, then a pretty good battle between the enemies fairly early on. However, the second half is by far the best.In Godzilla: King of The Monsters, Millie Bobby Brown was an integral part (paid $1M) but in this, she was sidelined to a minor role (still paid $3M), but IMO, the new standout was multi-generational deaf girl, Kaylee Hottle (about 8 yrs old) - who by dint of her situation can convey emotions by just a few movements of her face.Eiza Gonzalez ticked off Kong one too many times, and received her just dessert.Finally the two battle it out in an epic bout, similar to another Kong; \"King Kong Bundy\" and \"Andre the Giant\" of WWE with a touch of Mike Tyson thrown in. Candidly - at the 'double team' near the end I almost expected 'Vince McMahon' to have a cameo ... lol.Who won or \"falls?\"... Watch and see.

And King Kong was a nice update of King Kong. He was really Kong. Fierce, King of his domain. KONG!!!!Putting both Titans together to see who would bow to whom was the question. That's what I bought the popcorn for and went to the show for. And going in it was a good question until...the humans and THAT THING.I'm not going to write that the adult humans in any of the older films were a bundle of dramatic acting for an academy award winners either, but some were funny and of course we all grew tired of the \"I'll get some tea...Want some tea\" Godzilla (Mothra, Rodan etc.) jokes. While the women here have more titles, they still were bland and boring.And the children. The children were mostly delightful in these Godzilla romps. In Godzilla vs. Kong, the child was okay, but was missing an \"it\" factor that could have blossomed into something better for Kong and Godzilla - and for KIDS! These kids give no connection for other kids to become a part of the story. That's a big element in these family friendly Godzilla/Kong, etc. Films.(Spoiler) I am not, never was and never will be a fan of ... THAT THING. What goof thought it would be?!?!? I always thought it was such a cop-out that came out of the 'real' 60s Godzilla age of films into the 70s. But it was Godzilla's issue. Why bring it on with Kong, for goodness sake. Boooooo!I'm just sayin' with two mighty Titans, what a crap move to throw THAT THING in as many darn Titans they COULD HAVE done instead. And place in Hong Kong - and why HONG KONG? Can't they one go to..New Zealand or Australia or...New York or MONSTER ISLAND???? And (not a fan of the sub plot of under earth or middle earth or whatever earth ...story either).Now to be honest, my fingers were crossed for both, I couldn't pick a camp Godzilla or King Kong as they each kick behind! The CGI was really good, the fights were really good and if nothing else watch it for that.But I would have liked this much better with fewer humans, a better story of bringing them together and may I suggest some other Titan that would have made sense like Amhuluk or Methuselah or...heck I would have even accepted Behemouth -- anything but THAT THING to appear in Godzilla vs. Kong!"}, {"reviewer_name": "fosnock", "date": "4 April 2021", "text": "I gave it an extra star as it reminded me of watching Godzilla movies when I was a kid, and just like then who cared about the plot."}, {"reviewer_name": "fhite-99808", "date": "4 April 2021", "text": "Only reason this is a good movie is how epic the battles are, even the short one-sided ones.

The first time was in 1962 in a Japanese movie that was released in the states in 1963. They both had their own solo movies in what they are calling the new Monsterverse before clashing in this one; Kong:Skull Island in 2017 and Godzilla:King of the Monsters in 2019-the producers have said that their earlier movies are not part of this continuity. Alexander plays the lead here instead of Kyle, who had the lead in the Godzilla film-here, Kyle doesn't do much except to look for his daughter Millie. Millie and a couple of her friends are on a side story trying to discover what got Godzilla all riled up in the first place. Rebecca is trying to take care of Kong and keep him away from Godzilla-good luck with that-and Demian is the bad guy stirring up....well, he has a surprise for both monsters. The battles-and there are several-between Godzilla & Kong are great. They are some knock down drag out fisticuffs, with both getting in good licks. It kind of reminded me of a wrestling brawl. You also learn about the origins of both Titans and where they came from. There has been some discussion about the height differences and it is talked about here-Godzilla is 393 feet tall and Kong is 336 feet tall-and why Kong has grown some.It's rated \"PG-13\" for violence, monster gore and language and has a running time of 1 hour & 53 minutes.Overall, the storyline was okay but the battles between the Titans was worth the price of admission.

This entry in the franchise kicks up the scifi-fantasy a few notches but makes up for it with a beautiful emotional and primitive story at it's core. It dazzles with raw aggression and a free-falling gravity of explosive imagery. It's far-fetched but a good ride, I wasn't prepared to have the storyline sink in but they handled it well and really grappled with the emotional pull. The synthesizer soundscore was breathtaking and stood out to me and carried this film surprisingly well for cohesion. I was impressed and arrested enough to enjoy the experience and at the end my theater clapped and the room seemed to have a really good response to the overall film. In tone it is fantastical and unbelievable but the imagery is captivating and the characters who serve as emotional anchors really held this together. Overall I would say the theater experience is the way to go, I'm not gonna rush out to buy this on dvd but for a one time watch it was a special little thing and served the CGI series well. Not as dark and minimal as 2014's Godzilla which I still loved the 2014 film. But this one brings the sensibility of King Kong to the industrial mix and it is an interesting hybrid to see again.

Entertaining Titan action? Check . Kickass visual effects? Check - it's John 'D. J.' Des Jardin leading the pack here. Lesser human involvement in the plot? Check . Better emotional arc for at least one of the two behemoths? Check - it's almost Kong's movie, you can say. Godzilla vs. Kong delivers on most of these counts, and it acknowledges the atrocious nature of its plot to full effect.There are some uninteresting human characters here too, something the MonsterVerse has quite not been able to crack. However, the film's few emotional moments feature two characters who cannot talk - Jia (Kaylee Hottle) and Kong. As compared to Godzilla: King of Monsters, the humans only act as plot-forwarding devices here. They want the two Titans to battle it out in explosive action, demolishing ships, neon-lit skyscrapers, and everything else in their path. That's what director Adam Wingard gets right.Godzilla vs. Kong also veers further away from the gritty style of the previous films, almost embracing a much lighter tone in its approach (notably, in its dialogues). The climactic showdown is sheer eye candy - if this sort of thing is your idea of it. Wingard conceives the action from greater heights, as opposed to the style of Gareth Edwards (who pictured it more from the ground level); a style that works given the film's visual canvas and scale. Clocking in under two hours, it also doesn't overstay its welcome. Godzilla vs. Kong is quintessentially made for the big screen, and its technicalities only reinstate that. It's the big, dumb action flick that ALMOST works.P.

In this battle, the pace meets the middle well and give you enough components to rationalize the contest, without sacrificing the action that the trailers promised. Is it cheesy? Yes! However, Godzilla vs. Kong does puts some pieces together from previous films to get fans of the series excited to see where they went with all their teases. It's a nice inclusion of the other movies, and a fan service to help add that fun factor the Monsterverse groups will love. Fan Service extends to some other things as well including some homages to the tropes of this genre, a few moves that our actors used to do, and of course some hidden Easter eggs hidden in the wings to keep you looking.The story itself is again decent for this type of series, finally expanding the story past the human element and really digging into the lore of the Titans, well partially any way. Character integration is balanced between two main plots, cascading back and forth between the two as each builds upon the story and teases where the climactic end is going to go. Humans work in tandem with the beasts, but the titular monsters never take a back seat for two long in their quest for dominance. Surprisingly, the monsters themselves have a little more depth than I expected, especially the King Of The Jungle whose backstory from Skull Island gets more emphasis and really makes the monkey more layered than I ever imagined. Much of the story is told not so much through words, but the world building itself and this match further expands on the foundations built in the King Of the Monsters legacy. New worlds and lairs become new frontiers to uncover the mystery, and much of it is done in that stellar CGI animation that we've upgraded each year. Good depth, shading and contouring, and fantastic architecture designs all come together to bring the worlds to life and help dive into this clash. Yet the animation of all the creatures overshadowed the design for me and it accomplishes everything you can hope for. All the dynamic motion of the monsters is so well done, and the fights unleashed are filled with that ferocity you want of these titans trying to claim dominance in the world. Fists and talons are smoothly animated, and manage to capture the physiology of their modeled animals quite well to really bring all the fights to motion.My two favorite components though are the human to monster balance and the fights (the latter is no surprise right?). For the human components, their inclusion was not some convoluted, metaphysical, philosophical inclusion, merely the pawns to get the beasts in motion. However, they take it one step further and help expand the CGI counterparts' story to deeper levels than the previous films accomplished. In addition, the comedy a set of them brings is well timed, though a bit excessive, to help lighten the mood and give you appreciation for the writing of the film. As for the action, well you should be quite pleased with what they've brought to the screen for you, and how fitting it is for the theater. Epic sound editing, blaring music, and the full bells and whistles come out in style during the battles embedded in this film. And while ese qualities are very important, it's really how each battle started to elevate in stakes and move sets that impressed me. It's the battle at the end that really seals the deal, taking all you love from the giant monster genre and put the new skin on it with a little more savagery added in. While not quite perfect, and much of the boat battle had been revealed in the trailers, the movie's biggest selling point is indeed the action sequences.As for limitations for me... it primarily hovers around the pacing and how it affected the story. Again, the pace is balanced, but so many gaps from the three year period needed to be filled in a bit better for me given how the last film ended, assuming they did not do another branching comic book. This film has improved, but the story is still limited with plenty of convenience, nonsense, and suspense of disbelief you have to swallow to not be drawn away. If it meant less time getting bogged down in human drama and more time for action it works, but I'll admit there was so much to explore and explain when more twists and plot devices emerged from this lost land. Those cool world building elements I mentioned earlier have so much more to show, but the time constraints speed through these moments and leave plenty for your eyes to roam, but not get to explore as much, potentially leaving for another sequel to expand on. It requires you to keep your eyes open to find clues as to where this story will go, or perhaps find excuses to help fill in the gaps, which is fun. However, a little more explanation and planning could have gone in to this film to help really deliver more given all the buildup they did in the first act of the film. In addition, they still have not quite escaped the traps of worthless characters or over built characters who did little in terms of the actual movie. Though I again enjoyed less humans... we did need more explanation or involvement for some of the characters that contributed so much, and once again including them for means to invest in these characters and that is still what's needed in this series. As for the fights, while very good, the final part of the climactic fight still needed some work to really maximize the direction they take it and show what creativity in fight choreography can look like. It's still a great fight, but there was just a little more amping in the final part that needed to be cleared up.The VERDICT:Kong and Godzilla's fight may have had some high expectations, countless doubts, and some rocky shores to tackle, but I was very pleased with the product that came out. It moves quickly to keep things exciting, as fan service, storytelling, and action are integrated to be as inclusive as one can get in the 120 minutes they have. Fantastic visuals and a focus on the monster and their world really elevates this movie more, and the action scenes that the trailer promised hit so many levels to accomplish the adrenaline fest you are looking for. Still, the plot and world building still need work, with some polishing and more time to help expand upon everything they teased at in this film. Some of the devices are a bit too convenient, but if you can ignore those you'll be just fine, given the excitement the fight brings. Definitely worth a trip to theater given all the special effects, I encourage many to check this installment out and hopefully have this battle of legends entertain you with its CGI heavy splendor.My scores for the film are:Action/Sci/Thriller: 7.5\nMovie Overall: 7.0."}, {"reviewer_name": "Sir_AmirSyarif", "date": "30 March 2021", "text": "Adam Wingard takes MonsterVerse to another, higher level.

And that's coming from a big kaiju fan.I have always enjoyed watching big monsters fighting, especially when their scale is shown and put into context. We've all seen how big Godzilla is, and Kong in Skull Island and especially here where he's grown substantionally.I'm not saying it's neccessarily terrible or anything like that, I just think we could have gotten more.The plot is pretty dissapointing, especially after the superbly depicted comparison between humans and monsters in KOTM. That movie took a different approach and showed that in a world where these huge monsters exist, in the end we wouldn't be so different from them. In KOTM there are clear protagonists and antagonists, both on the human side and the monster side which is wonderful, and puts the movie down to earth and makes us relate and understand the characters and their motivations (at least as much a movie about a giant lizard and a three-headed dragon fighting can), but that kind of plot and character development is nowhere to be found. The people in the movie are just there. They have no purpose or impact in the overall story and events and are really poorly done. All of the characters I did care for are just dumped away or given a bad role which just bleaches all of them out.The action scenes are of course great, the CGI is stunning and the fighting scenes are well executed showing the strenghts and weaknesses of both Kong and Godzilla. There just aren't many of them.In the end another monster appears whose potential is just wasted. Also, huge potential for a nice battle between two of the most beloved and well known monsters with so many ideas for a nice story behind it but none of it is there. There are no motives to initiate the fight and it just ends up being a huge CGI fight with no real consequence. The plot doesn't drive Godzilla or Kong towards a goal, there are no stakes in the end battle and it just turns out bland and not very memorable. I mean, they both existed separately before and there is no real reason for them to fight in this movie other than the \"let's fight\" kind of situation. It just doesn't sit with me and is not what I expected from this movie.All in all the movie is still watchable, it has good action scenes which will appeal to most people, it's just nothing great and isn't a complete failure by far. There isn't a specific thing that's wrong with it either. It's just that all points that make a movie good or even great are slighty missed and it fails slightly in every aspect, making it not to be a disaster but just \"meh\"."}, {"reviewer_name": "masonfisk", "date": "12 April 2021", "text": "Recently released in theaters & on HBO MAX, we have the fourth film in the Monster Universe (following 2014's Godzilla, Kong: Skull Island & Godzilla: King of the Monsters from 2019) & so far for me the verdict is watchable w/a slight chance of eye rolling. Catching up on characters we didn't need, specifically Millie Bobby Brown & her pops, Kyle Chandler, we now have Bryan Tyree Henry as a paranoid blogger out to expose the nefarious activities of an all encompassing conglomerate, run by Oscar nominee Demian Bichir & his daughter, Eiza Gonzalez, as they try to mine a power source from inner Earth (a Jules Verne like inner world within our planet where the Titans have come from). Also in the mix is a scientist, played by Alexander Sarsgaard, a proponent of an inner Earth theory (he wrote an unsold book on the subject & his brother died trying to reach there), hoping to tag along w/primatologist, Rebecca Hall, Kong's current keeper & studier, who is mounting Kong's return to inner Earth (on Bichir's dime) before Godzilla attacks him (everyone thinks the big green one is out to stake out his rep as the biggest & the baddest but is there something more to his attacks?). Did I mention a hearing impaired moppet who has taught Kong sign language (& Hall's adopted daughter), played by Kaylee Hottle, is there to be the emotional anchor of the piece? Much better than its last entry, this film still suffers from uninteresting humans creating unnecessary conflict populating a universe where giant creatures ransack entire cities (in this film's case Hong Kong, take that communist mainland!) so instead of focusing on streamlining the human interaction to a minimum so the fisticuffs can be center stage, we have forehead smacking attempts at humor (Henry's character was so off putting I was hoping Kong would step on him) or nonsensical stabs at pseudo science. Come on Hollywood, you have nearly 60 years of cinematic blueprints available to you to show you how to do it right (my personal fave is still the 2014 entry) so give Toho studios the benefit of the doubt they know what they're doing.

One couldn't exactly see that coming since its immediate predecessor was filled with melodramatic subplots and the preceding spin-off was filled with extremely shallow characters. This movie however does everything right by focusing on the giant monsters and reducing the human characters to sidekicks.Genre fans will certainly get everything they could ask for. The locations are creative, diversified and spectacular. The visual and sound effects are at their very best and should be enjoyed at a local movie theatre. The numerous fight scenes between the giant monsters are dynamic, epic and gripping from start to finish. The film has excellent pace and entertains smoothly with a perfect running time just below two hours. This movie should be the convincing finale to a franchise that has been built up through the past seven years instead of attempting to continue milking the cow. I'm however curious to discover the next Japanese movie featuring Godzilla in the future.At the end of the day, don't expect any charismatic actresses and actors, don't look for a creative plot with twists and turns and don't pretend that this movie might be considered a future classic that will stand the test of time. What you get here however is one simple on paper but perfectly executed science-fiction action blockbuster that offers some welcome escapism in difficult times."}, {"reviewer_name": "forchennfederation", "date": "28 June 2021", "text": "Godzilla vs. Kong was a long-awaited film not just for the year 2021 but also for the past close-to 60 years since the original King Kong vs. Godzilla, for it features a cinematic rematch between the King of the Monsters and the 8th Wonder of the World. I've been a fan of both the Godzilla and King Kong franchises and I've been such a fan of the MonsterVerse for how much the people running it understand and for how the series emulates the sheer essence of classic monster movies, like the best Godzilla movies of old, while updating it with modern effects. And, let me say that Godzilla vs. Kong was well worth the wait and so much more. This was a great monster movie and an absolute blast of a film. Now, here's why.Spoilers from this point forward.The plot in summation is that, after a sudden and unprovoked rampage by Godzilla, who was once thought to be a protector, Monarch has to move Kong to the Hollow Earth in order to find him a new home while a conspiracy revolving around the company Apex Cybernetics is delved into that may connect to Godzilla's change in behavior as the film culminates to an epic showdown between Kong and Godzilla that will settle an ancient rivalry between the two Titans.First of all, the visuals and the action are truly spectacular. From the set piece in the Tasman Sea to the entirety of the Hong Kong battle (and I do mean, both parts of it), the monster fights are done in a way where one would get the sense of not just the sheer sizes of the Titans onscreen, but also the impact of the hits that they lay on each other (and, boy howdy, do they lay some good hits on each other); the sound design and mixing alone brings so much to the action scenes that it's practically Oscar-worthy (not that a film needs to win an Oscar in order to be great, but, still). The action also features some surprisingly brutal moments, such as when Godzilla claims victory over Kong during their Hong Kong bout by laying waste on the latter's chest by scratching it up and then stomping on it. While the monster battles have a different flow than those in past MonsterVerse entries in terms of how the monsters move, even that adds to the visceral nature of the battles. Not only are there such great and visually-striking moments in the action sequences, there are also great nods to older entries in the Godzilla and Kong franchises, such as when Kong goes for Godzilla's jaw trying to break it and even when Kong sticks the stub of his axe in Godzilla's mouth.The story is straightforward but executed so well, and the characters, while not the most three-dimensional, still do well for what they're intended to be and do, with the standouts being Jia (Kaylee Hottle) and Bernie Hayes (Brian Tyree Henry).Jia, a young girl from Skull Island's Iwi tribe who is also deaf, brings so much heart to the movie with her relationship with Kong while Bernie, a conspiracy theorist investigating Apex Cybernetics and the connection between them and Godzilla's sudden attacks, adds to the film as comic relief and he got laughs a-plenty from me with his interactions with Madison Russell (Millie Bobby Brown) and Josh Valentine (Julian Dennison). The rest of the characters, from Nathan Lind (Alexander Skarsg\u00e5rd) to Ilene Andrews (Rebecca Hall) to Apex CEO Walter Simmons (Demi\u00e1n Bichir), serve their purpose well. Granted, if there's one character that could've been more elaborated on, it would be the character of Ren Serizawa (Shun Oguri); one would be forgiven if they assumed that the film would address how he relates to Dr. Serizawa, Ken Watanabe's character from the previous Godzilla films in the MonsterVerse who died back in Godzilla: King of the Monsters, as well as go a little more into his perspective on Godzilla when his father dedicated his life in studying and dying for the Titan. However, Ren only serves as a side character working with Walter Simmons in creating and operating Mechagodzilla who then dies when Mechagodzilla turns against Apex due to Ghidorah's consciousness taking over when one of his skulls and neural network was used as a key component in the giant robot's operation. If Ren Serizawa had undergone a name change, the film wouldn't really change at all.That being said, this is a movie about the monsters, so let's discuss them. People seem to think that the Titans are just cogs in the spectacle when, if anything, they're characters as well with their own goals and personalities. Kong gets the most screen time out of all the Titans as he is the one who not only has the most significant connection to some of the human cast, that being Jia, but he is also the one who goes on a journey to the Hollow Earth to discover, along with Lind, Andrews, Jia, and company the true home of his species after Skull Island is overtaken by a perpetual storm. Meanwhile, Godzilla serves as a driving force for the plot as his attack on Apex's facility in Pensacola, Florida kickstarts the journey to the Hollow Earth, and is very intimidating yet has such standout and awesome moments when he battles Kong. Then, there's Mechagodzilla, the Titan-sized war machine build by Apex that is revealed to be the why for Godzilla's attack as well as essentially akin to Doomsday from Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice, except better because, whereas Doomsday was an element that occurred aside from the title conflict, Mechagodzilla is the reason for why Godzilla and Kong are trading blows and turns out to be more than a formidable adversary for even the combined powers of Godzilla and Kong when they team up.The acting is overall pretty good, including, as I mentioned earlier, Brian Tyree Henry as Bernie and Kaylee Hottle as Jia with the latter standing out as the giving the best performance in the movie which is all the more impressive when taking into account that a good chunk of her interactions are with Kong, a CG character, such as when she calms him down during a storm out at sea where he expresses his woes and longing for home in sign language. Millie Bobby Brown is also very good as Madison, despite having admittedly given a better performance in King of the Monsters. Demi\u00e1n Bichir also does great as Walter Simmons, appearing as if he was having a ball playing this eccentric human antagonist who seeks to make humanity the apex species once and for all, who also gets a great and even somewhat morbidly-amusing scene when he's killed by Mechagodzilla in the middle of a monologue. Alexander Skarsg\u00e5rd and Rebecca Hall do well playing their parts, even if their characters don't have the most depth despite how well they do serve the plot when it's all said and done.The film also gives us a look at the Hollow Earth, which has been hinted at and teased in Kong: Skull Island and Godzilla: King of the Monsters, which features an unusual yet visually-striking and beautiful setting that gives off a strong sense of wonder, such as with the throne room where Kong's ancestors used to live in.The soundtrack for this movie by Tom Holkenborg, while not quite as memorable as Bear McCreary's work in King of the Monsters, is still very much an epic collection of music and features some great tunes, such as the new themes for Godzilla and Kong, that are implemented into the film very well throughout, further adding to the scope of the film in both its action scenes and even in the film's quieter moments.So, to bring this review to a close, Godzilla vs. Kong is a spectacular entry in the MonsterVerse and a truly-epic action film that features a battle between two iconic movie monsters that wasn't thought to be possible years ago and was such a dream come true to see become a thing now. In a meta sense, this movie was a rematch, what a worthwhile rematch it was. The action is great, the monsters are done extremely well and have many great moments both in terms of action and otherwise, there are fun characters present both human and monster, the visuals are amazing and do such justice to the scope, scale, and impact of when the Titans clash, and the story goes by like a breeze which culminates in such satisfying payoffs.I love this movie to pieces, perhaps even about as much as I do Godzilla: King of the Monsters, and I am very much happy to see what the MonsterVerse has provided thus far in terms of how it respects and understands the Godzilla and Kong franchises, and I would love to see what is to come next. But, until then, I feel very strong in saying that I am more than satisfied with what we have now, including with Godzilla vs. Kong, for it is a film that, along with the other MonsterVerse films, I will gladly revisit many times in the years to come.Hail to the Kings, baby!"}, {"reviewer_name": "ilovesnakes1990", "date": "27 June 2021", "text": "Awesome movie definately best of the godzilla series so far cant wait to see what they do next."}, {"reviewer_name": "reecemgn", "date": "26 June 2021", "text": "Thoroughly enjoyed the movie.

I did not like 1998's 'Godzilla'. 2014's 'Godzilla' was fine, but not a movie I'd be interested in seeing again. I absolutely HATED 'Godzilla: King of Monsters'. I didn't like 'Kong: Skull Island'...And here I am: I watched 'Godzilla vs. Kong', and I'm divided. I really enjoyed the first half of the film, but I didn't like the second half. Ok, here's what I enjoyed. Thankfully Godzilla is no longer a friend to humans (pffff, yup, remember he was friendly towards humans in 'King of Monsters'...). The visuals during the first half were impressive and featured incredible scenes not seen before. I also enjoyed the use of old music like 'Loving Arms' and 'The Air that I breathe' in this new release. Well, that's about as much as I enjoyed.The human characters were incredibly bland and one-dimensional and I didn't care for any of them. Bernie, Josh and Madison served as comic relief. Whenever they were on screen, they completely ruined the suspense, excitement and flow of the movie, and would have been better without these characters - who served no purpose anyway. Oh, and Kong can now do sign language...wha-a-a-a-ttt???! Is this the mighty Kong, or Mighty Joe Young? How is he so clever and friendly towards humans?The film fell to pieces during the second half. With so much CGI, it might as well have been an animated film. It was way too fantastical to be believable - especially when they went in search of Hollow Earth. And when Kong entered his world and found a glowing axe, he goes to sit on a throne like a fu*king king!!! (wha-hahahahahahah!!!! What the bloody hell!! Seriously??!!). The human characters clearly played no part during the second half, which become preposterous to say the least. And one of the characters said \"This is why Godzilla attacked Apex. They're trying to replace him.\" So, a MONSTER knows they're building a robotic Godzilla??? You mean, this creature actually knows what's going on and understands the concept of a robotic Godzilla? Oh, yeah, forgot to mention this; they're capable of building a robot identical to Godzilla, fire breathing and all... Who the hell writes this craps and then spoon feeds the audience with this hilarious stupidity and expect them to sit there glued to the screen??Towards the end the film became so absurd I almost stopped watching. Ok, so I'm clearly no Godzilla fan, but hell there are some beyond stupid ideas in this film! 'Godzilla vs Kong' felt like a mash-up of previous Godzilla and King Kong movies, Journey to the Centre of the Earth, Rampage, Mighty Joe Young, and almost every other Hollywood superhero blockbuster out there.

It's Godzilla fighting King Kong it was always going to be entertaining.The problem, as always with these monsterverse films, is that they get bogged down in the annoying human stories. I really couldn't care less what Millie Bobby Brown and her pals are up to, I didn't buy my ticket to see a sub par plot with one dimensional characters and average performances, I came to see two giant monsters and cinema icons fight it out. When we did get down to this action it was really fun as expected, but I wanted more!What I did really enjoy about this film, and its why I prefer Kong to Godzilla, is that they made Kong into more of a character with emotions and relationships. These elements of the film were when it was at its strongest, and if they had brought the human characters into the film more through this avenue it would have worked better I think.The sci-fi elements of this film were also ridiculous and I didn't really care for them. Sure they were needed in a way to advance the plot, but they weren't particularly well done.Overall a fun but flawed film.

They aren't completely obscured by the particle effects, rain, fog, smoke, darkness, and other visual vaseline that ruined KOTH. For that reason alone this is worth a watch if you have HBO MAX, maybe skip the human stuff though, at least half of it.The human characters are still mostly insufferable. Millie Bobbie Brown, Paperboy, and the pudgey longhair kid are awful every second they're on screen. Seriously, who thought this was charming? They're not even so bad it's funny, it's on that razor's edge of cringe that's just totally irredeemable. Maybe the writing is just too self aware, maybe the direction they're getting is garbage (I'm guessing it's that), maybe the studio cut out some key details (also guessing that) but it's painful to watch every scene they're in.The other human characters are better, still not great, but they serve a purpose in advancing the story in a way that doesn't feel forced. Somehow the mute little girl does some better acting than Millie Bobbie Brown, actually to be frank she's better than most of the adult's with speaking rolls.Oh the young Japanese dude is supposed to be the son of Ken Watanabe from the last movie. Go watch a YouTube video for the stuff they cut with him because it is a damn shame. The characterization that's apparently still there in the novelization seems like it would have succeeded where every other human failed in the theatrical cut and given us a reason to care. (Watanabe died reviving Godzilla in KOTH, so his kid wants revenge because big lizard stole his daddy, and because his daddy spent too much time researching Godzilla and not enough raising his kid, there's a little potential there.)Anyway, all that matters is the monster fights. There are homages all over the place for fans. You could tell SOMEONE on staff, probably a higher up in the VFX pipeline really had some passion for the subject matter and it shows. There's an homage to the original Godzilla vs. Kong (probably many but one stuck out as obvious and honestly pretty funny as well) and the whole fight on the naval destroyers is a clear homage to Evangellion which was really cool to see.The biggest sin is that the human characters influence the outcome of the final fight at a critical moment in a way that is just PAINFULLY lame. I'm not going to ruin it, but someone thinks they're clever because they put a Chekhov's Gun in a gun holster. I see you writer, you aren't slick.Anyway, it just robs the ending of a little bit of emotional weight when you take the victory away from the monsters when they're the only characters anybody really care about. It should be a victory by one of them, not influenced by some unlikable superfluous humans.You could cut all the human stuff out and still get the basic story from the monster fights alone, which is enough to make the film good overall. At least you can ignore the filler and go right for the quality."}, {"reviewer_name": "zeratul108", "date": "22 April 2021", "text": "Great movie for what it is. Big titan monsters wrestling.

Fairies, the original Godzilla vs Kong film was ridiculous... There's a movie where Godzilla raises his son for 86 minutes...aliens from Planet X...Time Traveling monsters...The Godzilla universe can be really silly. It's a ridiculous, absurd movie but it fits with the universe. But, there are great godzilla movies, such as Godzilla 2000 or Godzilla vs. Destoroyah (1995), Destroy all Monsters (1968)...Which brings us to this movie, how ridiculous is it? It's a strange, action packed SCIFI fantasy with a bizarre plot that could fit inside of 3 separate movies...They journey to the center of the Earth to get a magical hammer with some sort of magical energy so that Kong can fight Godzilla with his magical hammer, meanwhile there's a mecha godzilla being created by human beings who gets this magical energy and becomes sentient and turns on humanity and fights the giant monkey and dinosaur.This movie lacks any profundity, unfortunately. It's off the wall, and doesn't seem to have any hidden depth to make it feel more meaningful. I didn't make any deep connection with any of the characters, kong and godzilla included. In fact, it's hard to remember 90 percent of the cast...(Been about a week and I just don't care to even remember.)I would also say that it lacks any real suspense... Even with the monster fights, you're just sort of watching mindless action on screen. There's a scene where they launch missiles at Godzilla to protect Kong, but they are both chilling in the same place... It's a very mindless action film. (Alot of this movie just doesn't make any damn sense...) But, if you're willing to unplug your brain to watch action films, this isn't a problem.Over all the movie really isn't that satisfying. It's like watching a ok Godzilla movie. I think that when the movies are from the 60s, 70s, 80s, some of the goofiness doesn't need to be explained. They had some weird, off the wall ideas about monster films back then but somehow it feels right now...However, this is an American adaptation and it didn't have to be so ridiculous...

It's a given that it's hard to spin a story around that where humans actually matter.Before I rant about the plot, I'll first focus on the positive, and I'll keep my rant short as many have already done so.The three significant places where there has been human involvement were:1) Kong being led to hollow earth,\n2) Kong being the first titan in clear communication with humans, and\n3) the creation of Mechagodzilla.All of these made sense to have a human hero carrying the idea forward. Mechagodzilla being tied to a villain is a good example to this.The most important one was, however, the little orphan girl (Kaylee Hottle, with arguably the best performance among the human actors in the movie to be honest). She made DIRECT communication with the beast. She influenced Kong, gave suggestions and instructions, connected on an emotional level.The other individuals riding along on the journey to hollow earth did make some impact in the story, but they weren't as significant.With all that being said...Why on earth did we need Millie Bobby-Brown's character? I really like her as an actor (also enjoyed Julian Dennison's performance even though the character was a bad comic relief), but with the presence of Kaylee Hottle's character, displaying the human-titan direct communication we viewers all craved to have seen for so long, we really, really did not need Millie's.There was only a single moment where that group's actions did anything positive to change the course of the titan battles, and it's the stupidest, smallest, most improbable little spark (no pun intended) that was force-fed into the plot.And oh boy I did NOT enjoy Brian Tyree Henry's character. He was a nuisance, an irritation, a poor attempt at humor and comic relief. I am usually impartial to badly written characters, but this one in particular was bad.This trio was placed as not a plot element, but a narrative one. Their only job and purpose was to show the audience what was going on \"behind the veil\" in Apex labs.If you completely cut them out of the story, with all their scenes, all their references, including her character speaking to her father, the plot would still move forward smoothly.The only time this would be broken is at the very end with the \"booze on the console\" thing. Even that could be changed with the computer just fritzing on its own. Nobody would notice.One last thing: Alexander Skarsgard's character. I mean, he's supposed to be a failed author on the hollow earth theory if I'm not mistaken, right? Not only do they already have a rough image of hollow earth readings, but have already built huge facilities that open up to hollow earth, along with vehicles capable of traversing the hypothesized gravity veil, and the journey was already tried before!So it's clearly there. So, how is this still being treated as a failed theory? I don't get it really. Besides, why even need him? Why recruit him for the mission? Just because his brother tried the voyage and died?---Overall, the movie gave quite a bit of entertainment for what it was.

Godzilla vs. Kong - such a disappointment...(Spoilers ahead)Way too complicated a storyline, it was hard to really keep track. What was I watching? Godzilla v Kong? Godzilla v Mechazilla? Journey to the Center of the Earth? Upside Down? Warcraft??I know there's a way more complicated backstory that involves not only the 2 preceding Godzilla/Kong movies (both were disappointing as well) but also all the original Godzilla movies...it was just way too much to all but diehard Godzilla fans.It was also hard to tell if they were going for a B-movie or Blockbuster vibe. I mean there's some amazing visual effects - some of the best animation I've ever seen - but then you have this guy sitting inside a giant skull that looks all too much like the styrofoam it's made from?Instead of having this super elaborate plot where....***DEEP BREATH***GZ is \"taunted\" by the presence of a robot version of himself which then sparks the need to bring Kong out of hiding to fight GZ because no one really knows about the robot so GZ gets sidetracked to take out Kong which results in a stalemate so now Kong has to go to the centre of the earth to get some ancient super weapon in the form of a magic axe after which he returns to fight only to be taken down so GZ can tango with the robot but GZ doesn't have the magic axe so Kong has to be the one to take out the robot and then they go their separate ways. All while little hoomans follow along.****catch breath***Simpler plot idea: Godzilla has left most of the world in shambles after his destructive reign. It's borderline post-apocalyptic. Kong has been hidden on Skull Island. Gets captured by humans who have had enough of GZ's BS.The island has been hiding Kong's presence from GZ. Humans unleash Kong to take out GZ, and chaos ensues. The end result is GZ is quashed by Kong, thus giving humans their victory, but Kong succumbs to his injuries and dies as well.2 titans. One epic fight. No winners. No losers. No robots or magic axes or journeys to the centre of the earth. A much simpler plot.Sorry guys. But Peter Jackson's KING KONG still reigns supreme!Oh and the tag line \"One will fall\"??

I'll tell you one thing, not the plot. I didn't care about a single one of the characters. I didn't even care why Kong and Godzilla wanted to fight. The makers of this film did a great job of strongly focusing on the fight. Too many of these versus movies focus on character, plot and set up. I couldn't mean it more when I say no one cares.Godzilla fighting Kong is what I dreamed of since I was a boy seeing the original. The fight just hit the spot. Beautiful CGI and well choreographed action. The inclusion of Mecha Godzilla being the big bad that brings the two Kaiju together made me do a little happy dance. I'd also like to give a quick shout out to the writers for including the nod to the original of kong being powered up by electricity.My biggest grievance of the film was Milly Bobby Brown running around with discount Alex Jones.

I loved Kong: Skull Island and through Godzilla: King of the monsters wasn't a bad film.Both Kyle Chandler and Millie Bobby Brown Chandler reprise there father and daughter roles as Mark and Madison Russell, they're joined by Alexander Skarsgard's researcher and author Nathan Lind, Rebecca Hall's, Kong specialist Ilene Andrews and Eiza Gonzalez's boss Mya Simmons.The film picks up a few years after Godzilla and 50 odd years after Kong. Godzilla is rampaging for some unknown reason and by Kong leading a team of scientists and researchers to the Hollow Earth, they might be able to find a way to stop him and save humanity, thus begins the Godzilla Vs. Kong of the title - like any good championship, there can be only one title holder.Though, herein also begins the nonsense involving Apex Cybernetics and their quest to use the power of these beasties to create something which gives mankind the upper hand and Monarch's inability to be anything other than a name that links to Skull Island.The Hollow Earth is criminally underused and the films writers missed a trick of setting the whole film here, with its vast array of new and dangerous creatures and landscapes and brining in a whole bunch of expendable grunts to be eaten in variously horrible ways. Instead, the whole Godzilla Vs. Kong debacle doesn't work. It looks like two fellas' in fancy dress outfits having a punch up on a drunken night out in Liverpool!The film isn't bad, the actors are very good, including the young Kaylee Hottle as Jia, though Millie Bobby Brown and Kyle Chandler, really collected a pay check for doing absolutely nothing - but good to see Kyle Chandler back in a better Kong film. The effects when the two title contenders weren't fighting against each other were very good, The Hollow Erath scenes were great, it just isn't the film I personally think should've been made.Hopefully, the ending sets up a new film in the Hollow Earth and things can get back on track."}, {"reviewer_name": "sean-25855", "date": "12 April 2021", "text": "This film is silly.

Godzilla Vs. Kong proudly follows in the footsteps of previous monster verse entries by being a horrible film with really, really good fight scenes. The human characters exist. That's pretty much all they have going for them. The villains were never a threat to anyone and really that whole section of the plot was just to manufacture situations where Kong, Zilla and Mecha G get to fight.There are two teams of humans: Team Kong which are some scientists, a clearly evil relative of the villain (she even dresses in all black) and a deaf little girl who can sign with Kong. And Team Godzilla which is Madison from KOTM, Madison's friend from High School and some conspiracy theorist guy who may or may not be right about everything. Madison was already a bit character, so I question the logic of making her a main protagonist, also she's kinda mean in this one. Something I find very amusing is that these two groups of people have zero interaction with each other. Team Gojira only exists to bring Mecha Godzilla in on the action and Team Kong exists to give Kong a powerup. MONARCH is there too, but their role appears to just be celebrity cameos and literally watching the chaos unfold impotently.My two major problems are 1. Godzilla is an absolute jerk and despite causing the whole plot everyone still treats him as the godlike hero of the film. And 2. The villains don't feel particularly villainous until the story forces them to make boneheaded decisions out of evil. For example: in the Third Act evil lady, who hasn't really done anything bad at this point, starts to harvest some of the weird Hollow Earth energy which was the sole purpose of the expedition. This is presented as bad for some reason and then a stand off occurs between the heroes who kidnapped Kong and brought him to Antarctica and the corporate goons. Predictably they all die for, y'know, doing their jobs and the heroes escape in the knick of time. The funny thing is that Kong, and likely the audience, would not even care if the bad guys didn't start pointing guns at everybody with no prompting.After that, Godzilla and Kong meet up and fight for a while before Mecha Godzilla, also a harebrained villain scheme, shows up and takes center stage. Then the music goes all Man of Steel. While the fights are cool, they still try and shoehorn the humans in to complete their paltry character arcs. Then the movie ends.

This is no longer a choice and more of a given especially in fictional movies and movies that have \"big scary monsters\".Directing: Adam is known for his horror movies and makes a great director. I would have preferred to see Peter Jackson directing this, but nonetheless, Adam did a great job. Having said that and while watching I didn't get the feeling of connection between any of the characters. There wasn't a single scene that popped out to me.Production: It is clear as day that the investment in the production of this movie is substantial, also noting that they brought in many producers and co producers from the previous movies like Mary Parent, Brian Rogers and Thomas Tull who is known for his work in the 2014 Godzilla, Inception, and Pacific Rim. They delivered a cinematic wonder with Epic Visuals and attention to detail.Script: I was especially disappointed with the lack of character emphasis and buildup. This, in my opinion would have taken this movie to a whole new level. Not only this, but the lack of emotional connection between the characters themselves.Acting: This is where things become interesting, the acting is questionable when the script and directing are set to make a character seem emotional when in fact that is not the case. The problem here is not the actors' performances but more the roles assigned to them and their script that made them seem blander or for better terms mechanical.Cinema and sound: No objections here, the epicness of the movie is based on the perfection of the cinematography and the CGI making it one of the best I've seen in a while. Amazing score by Tom Holkenborg that matched perfectly.Conclusion: If you want to see epic cinematic clash between two titans then this is a must watch! Just, don't expect any emotional or dramatic attachment with any of the characters except maybe with Jia, the little girl.

Lots of massive CGI fights scenes between Godzilla and Kong, plus loads of human characters and side stories that you don't care about whatsoever. It is the definition of a popcorn film, to turn your brain off, watch and enjoy !! Trying to actually critique this film would be stupid..............however as stupid has been referred to as my middle name, I'll give it a shot.To me this franchise is slowly but surely getting worse and worse the more films that are made. I am one of the minority who actually really really loved \"Godzilla\" all the way back in 2014, thought it was an interesting take on the monster genre. I thought not showing Godzilla that much was ballsy and worked for me, sort of like an homage to \"Jaws\". Also thought that \"Kong: Skull Island\" was a decent fun film with a great cast and interesting introduction to Kong in this re-boot..............However this is where things get wobbly to say the least. Godzilla 2 (I cant remember the sub text) was horrific in so many ways. A huge fall in quality from the first one and just a mess of a film for the majority............although still had parts that were mild entertaining................... Now enter this film and I'm sad to say Godzilla vs Kong is following the pattern started by the last entry. The story is ridiculous, boring, cliche, stupid and often dumbfounding. The actors are trying their best (god bless em') but all of their characters are so 2 dimensional, wooden and often laughably bad. This is all a result of terrible planning and writing on behalf however put this film together. I'm not even gonna bother google their name to shame them because at the end of the day its only Godzilla vs Kong, I'm not gonna lose sleep over this film being stupid haha.There will inevitably be yet another sequel coming in a few years time and just be another crap-fest of boring characters watching monsters fight endlessly. I thought this franchise had a bit of potential in its early days but its taken a directional change that is just bonkers to be honest. The most scary part is that this script actually was the one the studio chose and had faith in...........what on earth were the other scripts like that they didn't, if this was the best one (insert shocked face)At the end of the day though it's an ok piece of entertainment coming in under 2 hours (by some miracle) 65% out of 100 and I am being kind because hey its fights are cool I suppose and the actors are trying. It'll be great background noise when I'm busy doing something else (It definitely ticks that box)btw why was Kyle Chandler in like 2 scenes the whole film I swear you saw more of him in the trailer than you did in the film ????

It became pure fantasy whereas look at the 2014 Godzilla. Everything had a real base to compare it to1. All the cities, tech and interacions looked real which lead onto point 22. Godzilla and the other two MUTO looked massive. Every camera angle, every sound, every movement, muscle sway in the monsters, interation with surrounding objects made all three MUTO look remarkably huge. It was the best thing about the movie. The new movie had them looking like they were only 25 ft tall3. All the characters were really REALLY well developed in the 2014 Godzilla. We loved or hated them accordingly. In G v K, this was damned near non existent with no character development, or minimal at the least. Such a shame as the people in the 2014 Godzilla were such a huge part of the story.I enjoyed G v K as a lighter version. Kinda more like Pacific Rim. Nothning serious and generally only semi believable. As for Godzilla V Kong, I have seen the First Godzilla and the first Kong movies and they were amazing. Far superior to wahat I watched this week for sure.This movie?.... entertaining for my 10 year old, but that's about it.

A treat for the senses and dynamic CGI (but only sometimes).That said, why can't Hollywood ever seem to weave a great plot into movies like this? It's just lazy writing, and what makes it all worse is that if the cast can't believe what they're saying, how can we expect to believe it?A monsterverse. What a great and fun concept, if done correctly. Especially with the monsters we grew up with. You know what had a good plot? The very first King Kong. You simply didn't dread when the actors would come on screen.And I don't blame the actors. In other films (lol, films...) most of these actors do a great job. It's all about the direction and script here. As with any movie, the actor is only as good as the material, and the way they are directed to emote and display that material.In my opinion, the director saw what he had to work with on paper, and just phoned it in. Hey, they're professional actors, let them figure out how to play their parts. Right?No. Hardly ever. There are surely some we could point to and say they have the intelligence and depth to self-direct, but most don't have that ability. As a matter of fact, everyone from DeNiro to Brando to Keaton (think Something's Gotta Give) have been misdirected and turned in lack-lustre performances.The movie review is this: Good, solid CGI for much of the film. Poor, boring acting. Poorly written dialogue.I personally don't want to laugh AT a movie or film I'm watching. Stupid, unintelligible plot lines that pull me out of the story because of total improbability isn't cool.

Not at all. It is a raw unsophisticated thirst for senseless violence motivated by a child-like curiosity. The story and context are secondary and only there to create the best part which is the spectacle.The monster fights deliver. Fans will be pleased. Like some UFC prize title fight, King Kong and Godzilla beat each other senseless for our pleasure. The fight choreography elevates the spectacle. Both Titans aren't just animals clawing at each other. There are built-in beats where they're contemplating and strategizing what they're doing. There are moments that resemble a street fight that factors in the environment as well.The climactic fight was especially fun because it is set in Hong Kong, namely my neck of the woods. For anyone who has been here, there is an irony to it all. Hong Kong Island is such a tiny place. You could hold up a sidewalk walking together with a friend. Someone behind would cut through you impatiently and give you a dirty look. So it's fun seeing fictitious monsters bulldozing the city and clearing the view. \"Yes, please! Let's start again...\"As for the human characters, there are huge opportunities missed from a lack of development. Rebecca Hall and Kaylee Hottle as a mother and her mute adopted daughter, who act as the human connection to King Kong was the most engaging subplot, making for some of the film's grand-scale quiet moments.Demian Bechir's storyline as the head of the new evil corporation Apex goes unexplored and ends up as a by-the-numbers sci-fi villain. Millie Bobby Brown's own investigation on Apex is a perfunctory subplot. She felt like Penny from Inspector Gadget, trying to complete a mission hiding from her father Kyle Chandler, who rightfully should have been the character carrying that particular story. Also, I really missed Charles Dance.The first Gojira remains my favorite Godzilla movie. It had real subtext. Godzilla was a metaphorical force of nature as a result of mankind dropping the atomic bomb. Godzilla was nature fighting back and it was serious, which made his presence so much scarier.Legendary's Monsterverse is set up where they can cross decades with their timeline and the human characters (or movie stars) are secondary to the monsters. I see that as a positive as it opens up for a variety of human stories to be told from different perspectives. That's not used here in Godzilla vs Kong.The 2014 Godzilla, the first of this series, was a grittier film that explored such themes. Godzilla's appearance was more restrained and hidden. This changed as the franchise adopted more of an MCU universe-building approach and the allegorical stuff began to fade away. It is barely here in Godzilla vs Kong.I am still waiting for some filmmaker to make a definitive monster movie that can balance the monster fights and allegorical themes one day. That's yet to be accomplished.Godzilla vs Kong is a fun ride but as the franchise is focusing more on monster fights instead of the human element, I could feel the foundation crumbling away.

Sure the story can get ahead of itself many times with outrageously coincidental convenient plot lines, but the intention of this film was to portray Godzilla versus Kong which it does in absolutely behemoth action packed fashion.While the human drama aspects do kill momentum at times, I would say they are executed better than the first two Godzilla films by far especially with the addition of the young girl's character that adds tremendous emotional depth to Kong. There are scenes of forced comic relief that do seem rather unnecessary. I still think skull island had the best cast and human drama/comedy thanks to mostly John C Reilly. This particular cast is still fairly strong.Getting back to the high points of the film in my opinion, were the insanely crisp and intense battle scenes. Superb top notch CGI work on both titans and just an overall astounding color pallet in all the details and settings. The visuals are immaculate and set the bar very high for the genre. In the first two Godzilla films the complaints of darkened battle scenes were warranted and I can really only bet it was because the CGI in the monsters were subpar. That is not the case in this film at all.As I mentioned earlier, the story does tend to nearly go off the rails about three different times but I do appreciate the swings for left field . There are just too many moments that are so outrageously conceived to take seriously but then I remember it's not to be taken seriously...Overall it's a fantastic spectacle that may be in the biggest cinematic scale we've seen so far which in itself must be witnessed on the big screen.

Let me be clear the scenes when both monsters are there are great and give a feeling of grandeur. The first part of the final fight was epic. And that's about it.now let's get to the negatives:\n1) the monster plotline. Its common to monster movies to have an a and b plotline, one covering the monster and the other covering the humans. Most times they have a thematic connection(not here). . The monster part doesnt cover Godzilla at all(This is clearly a King movie)and he completely disappears from the world when a fight doesnt happen. The Kong part is way too long. I wonder how you can focus at something in your movie for so long without anything noteworthy happening. Also Kong while he has a goal(to find his ancestral home and possibly his family) doesn't grow or use what he finds to his advantage. I mean he is a big ape and apes are known for learning. Yeah he found that axe and it helped him(more than it should have), but wouldnt it be cooler if he made it himself? Kong loses to Godzilla,Kong mad, Kong use tool made of Godzilla to win. Better in my opinion while also highlighting what makes the two monster unique.2) the humans plotline. What was the point? What did the humans achieve? You cover them for half the movie and their contribution to the plot was zero. Oh they spilt coffee to the monitor controlling mecha Godzilla? And that affected him in only a small part while also rob Kong and Godzilla from having a clear victory? Hot stuff. Great contribution and what a way to solve the problem. Next3) The plotholes and the movie inconsistencies. Don't get me started. Turning your brain off is a must in this one and it really shouldn't be. I mean in the previous Monsterverse movies you had to turn off your suspension of disbelief and give the movie some leeway but not disable your critical thinking completely. At least the others made sense in the movie setting. Why destroy established rules and settings?4)Killing off the other titans off screen. Way to kill the franchise. And right when people were getting excited for most of them. Better than having more movies if they were going to turn up like this one.5)Not having a clear winner. I mean come on. You had ONE JOB. The title says it all GODZILLA VS KONG. There must be a winner. Having them team up to kill a common threat is boring. You clearly didn't learn from BVS. I know that the fandom will complain if their favorite monster doesnt win but thats the way with conflicts. Someone must win. And I believe that most wont be salty about the outcome if you present a good reason why it came to be.There are more if you wanna nitpick but I think that's enough. At the end of the day one must ask:what kind of movie is this? They tried to play it smart when in my opinion it should have been a clear war movie. A war between two titans. That is what all wanted to see. The time that producers realize that just a title or a brad or a franchise doesnt guarantee the paycheck cant come soon enough."}, {"reviewer_name": "mrstieve", "date": "7 April 2021", "text": "I'm 4 minutes in and this is just absolute trash.

Godzilla had amazing suspense but not enough monsters. Kong Skull Island had great monsters and some decent humans but it didn't do anything new and King of the Monsters had outstanding monsters but terrible humans so how does Godzilla vs Kong hold up?First of all, we get some incredible monster stuff. Sure we only get 2 Godzilla vs Kong fights but they are incredible. It shows off the powers and strengths of these Titans perfectly and these fights happen in different places: whether it's the sea or in land and they use the environments perfectly. The fights are also incredibly well shot. There's no shaky cam or unnecessary close ups or cuts back to humans. It's wide shots and the action is easy to follow and it's well lit so it's easy to see everything, even at night during the Hong Kong battle. The colors are also incredibly gorgeous especially the Hollow Earth stuff and the visuals are unsurprisngly amazing. The score, whilst nowhere near as good as King of the Monsters, is still bone chilling. The stuff in Hollow Earth provide some interesting worldbuilding, gorgeous scenery, fun monsters and an over the top but fun sequence where they travel to Hollow Earth.On to other matters, the movie is fast paced so you are never bored but it doesn't move too fast and on the human side, I enjoy the bond between Kong and the little girl. It's pretty charming and that moment when Kong speaks sign language is awesome. I also appreciate how Kong is more of a character. He's in the movie throughout and he gets some sort of arc where he finds his home and his people so that was a nice surprise. As I said, it's also nice that Kong is in the movie throughout with the humans, who are sadly necessary, so we never get bored with the human stuff.The movie also solves the issues that King of the Monsters has with the human stuff. WB understood that we don't care about the humans so Kong is put in the spotlight and they are just on for the ride and there are less of them and even though they are bland, they are more likeable, don't make stupid decisions. The plot is also much less complicated and simple with only a small amount of human characters. I'm really happy that WB understood we don't care for deep stories and humans and created something simple.The movie is not flawless though. While I don't go into a monster movie expecting deep humans, I would appreciate if they put care into it like what they did with Kong and the girl and the plot is really simple and generic. It's basically a simple version of Batman v Superman except that Superman is good. At the same time, there's no logic, plot holes galore or care for the laws of physics. Technology has apparently improved loads since King of Monsters and despite the fact that so many human lives should have been lost, the movie doesn't care unlike the previous monsterverse movies where there is some thought. If that's going to bother you, don't watch this movie. Also, the subplot with Madison is not very interesting but it is crucial to the plot so it's not a big deal.Overall, Godzilla vs Kong delivers what I wanted in a movie like this and while it would be nice for possibly more monsters like King of the Monsters, I'm very happy with what we got."}, {"reviewer_name": "ryanmo-35178", "date": "6 April 2021", "text": "The storyline is so weak.

With these new Kong and Godzilla movies, I love them too. I knew eventually we would have a Kong Vs Godzilla movie. I do love the kaiju/monster battles in this. They were amazing. More so because of the end with Mechagodzilla which we already knew would be in this. They did a great job with it. Especially with all the destruction and everything.But here in lies my problem. The sudden technological advancements in this movie really make it feel cheesy. In the old movies from past decades, seeing such things didn't matter because the series (well most of them), never took themselves super seriously. But these new ones tend to be a bit more human-based, a bit more realistic. Granted none of this is realistic really, but that's another story. Seeing flying ships and other fancy tech feels off in what is the modern day world. I know one is not to ask deep questions about a movie like this, but it still bugs you that somehow there is Apex has super-advanced tech and no one ever noticed.Then you get into the kind of weak story. I know the hollow earth thing has been pushed for awhile in these movies. But it again feels cheesy. Even the simplest of people know such a premise makes zero sense given how planets work. And then you get into the fact they were able to travel to it and somehow survive. Impossible.The perhaps best aspect of this movie was the little girl and her relationship with Kong. This girl was amazing. And of course seeing Mechagodzilla was great too, though what he looked like seemed a little silly compared to the old versions. I should mention they never really talk about WHY Godzilla and Long are fighting. Saying \"Who bows to who\" just seems like a silly cop-out. I just assumed MechaG was the one causing havok, thus trying to frame Godzilla. I wasn't expecting the weird plot of \"Kong and Godzilla be mad at each other because they both want to be king\".So does this mean I think the movie is terrible? No. Not by any means. But I feel it's maybe the weakest one in the modern Kong/Godzilla series so far. Though in the end the final action scenes really make it worth it. And as I said the little girl.

I loved Kong: Skull Island, but didn't really care for either Godzilla film. So I was interested to see how the culmination of the two titans' adventures would hold up. I found this film to be quite mediocre. Kong is definitely the highlight. He's a far more three dimensional character than his lizard co-star and his relationship with a little deaf girl is genuinely heartwarming and does a great job of humanising the monster. This film also has sold special effects and great cinematography. It's a real shame that most won't get to see this movie on the big screen because that's where it clearly flourishes. As for the titular event, it mostly delivers. The fight is well shot and very exciting. Although a lot of the action does take place in the dark, this time, they use brightly lit streets so that we can see what's happening. However, the negatives outweigh the positives. None of the human characters are particularly interesting, aside form the deaf girl. Millie Bobby Brown returns from King of Monsters and it feels like she's only there to cash in on the success of Stranger Things. Especially since this is the only time in the series that a main human character from a previous movie has returned. There's also a conspiracy subplot and a big suit villain that are uninteresting and take focus away from the titular monsters. Also, the ending is terrible and a cowardly move from the studio. Once you see the film, you'll know what I mean. It's a real jump the shark moment from the series. Is this film worth seeing? If you can see it in cinemas then yes.

However, when the Godzilla vs. Kong trailer came out in January, things were very clear: the incomparable Gojira is a king amongst titans, possessing nuclear breath and various other awesome powers, whereas Kong is monke (sic) and so is obviously gonna win!I'm really loving what some geeks have become. Not even Kong meeting Godzilla is serious business anymore - it was certainly fun to see memes which theorized that, in true Batman vs. Superman fashion, the two kaiju would resolve their supposedly Earth-shattering rivalry by discovering that both their mommies are named Mothra. This joke was everywhere.Good one, folks. But I think a timelier joke would be to demand the scrapped four-hour cut that tacks on Gigan and Jet Jaguar in an artsy dream sequence where Gidorah jokes about giving Zilla a handjob. It wouldn't be that much sillier than having news sources speak matter-of-factly about \"Godzilla attacks\" and \"Kong whisperers\".Seriously, though, if you anticipated a victory for either legendary beast in Godzilla vs. Kong, as opposed to another showdown that ends with the two icons teaming up to thwart a common foe (in this case Mecha-Godzilla, working on some sort of weird-ass Pacific Rim rules), you may have been too optimistic. It happened with Batman and Superman, and it sorta happened with the previous Godzilla picture; neither of these films was loved by critics so maybe Warner Bros. Is using an \"If at first you don't succeed...\" approach with this model.Of course there must be a human element. Humans were deemed over-present in the 2014 film, yet underdeveloped in its sequel - which instead has so much booming action it got boring.This one is similar, not for lack of star power; we get to see the likes of Alexander Skarsg\u00e5rd, Rebecca Hall, Millie Bobby Brown, Brian Tyree Henry (as a \"Titan Truther\"), Shun Oguri, Eiza Gonz\u00e1lez, Julian Dennison, Demi\u00e1n Bichir, and many others either gawk nonchalantly at 9/11 times 1000 or get involved. I suppose Brown, Dennison, and Henry have some fun interactions, but overall, the humans aren't exactly what you'll be remembering these films for.GvK isn't all about brainless action, though. Sometimes it wants to make ya think, which doesn't always necessitate human beings we care about. For some, it might be enough that the spectacle takes a moment to make us consider man's relationship to nature (in many ways a force to whom we're arguably powerless) and his capacity to play God - something I can attest we most certainly haven't learned to avoid yet. Matt Zoller Seitz wrote of the kaiju: \"They're animals jockeying for dominance, over territory and each other. If we hadn't treated Earth like a toilet for centuries, they would've stayed beasts of song and legend, talked about but never seen.\" Still, it's hardly mind-blowing.As a simple wrestling match between two beloved kaiju icons, Godzilla vs. Kong is occasionally fun, particularly when it doesn't distract us with on-the-nose comedy, confusing visuals (despite Adam Wingard's keen eye for color), and characters whose careless stupidity shouldn't permit such convenient survival over and over. We might also question that King Kong has yet again been re-sized - even though Kong: Skull Island made him far larger than the chunky gorilla we saw in the Merian C. Cooper or Peter Jackson films, he needed to be tweaked even more to stand a chance against Godzilla. Maybe he was still a baby back when Skull Island took place.

The fighting scenes are remarkable and the human presence as much as it should be. The story has a few flaws I guess. The whole hollow earth part (that could have been a separate movie its self) should had being extended and thoroughly explained.I understand those who did not like the film. I guess not everyone is familiar with the franchise. The sudden appearance of Mechagodzilla may seem a little out there to those who are not familiar but in 70s Mechagodzilla was an extraterrestrial villain sent by aliens to confront Godzilla.

Maya Simmons (Eiza Gonz\u00e1lez) character was pointless and unneeded so has to be other villain in this movie you have 1 villain in movie that is Walter Simmons (Demi\u00e1n Bichir) look i love Eiza Gonzalez she is hottest Mexican girl I love she was known for From Dusk till Dawn TV series, Baby Driver, Altia Battle Angel, Fast & Furious Presents: Hobbs & Shaw, Bloodshot, Cut Throat City and many more movies she is in her character was just pointless because she is sent to join with in team with Nathan Lind (Alexander Skarsg\u00e5rd) and with Dr. Ilene Andrews (Rebecca Hall) to know what's going with Kong while he is ship theirs twist of film is she turns bad she is their to kill Kong I am like okay do you think at end of film she is their to kill Kong with her team A top-tier Apex Cybernetics executive oh she has to be daughter with main villain Walter witch was pointless she didn't need to be villain you know what she could been?? Just goodly having other villain to kill Kong was pointless movie just needs 1 human villain 1 villain monster that's all you need for this movie but she is their to kill Kong we all know that Kong is not gonna die in movie we all know that's not gonna happen but something has to happen in a very stupid way we all know Kong was not gonna die at film by Maya Simmons character unless if Peter Jackson King Kong written this movie then she would have won but her character wasn't needed at all their that was point it's not just because I am saying oh she is pretty and hottest girl I am trying to say she was pointless and unneeded what was point of having her entire half of movie to have her as villain and to kill Kong when his not gonna die in movie oh we need someone to try to Kong well you know he doesn't die in movie, described her role as a \"very smart woman behind a company.\" She also described the film as \"slightly comedic.\" Gonz\u00e1lez noted having enjoyed the fact that her character was a Latina woman with a high position within a company, and not forced into a stereotype I am like yeah was that smart of you trying to Kill Kong when you can't kill Kong with a ship with 50 cal machine guns is that smart??? I didn't need her character in movie at all I don't know how Eiza agreed to this movie and script and how did it make sense for her for this movie?? Who knows anyway in this movie all you need is 1 villain and 1 monster villain you don't need 2 villains in movie all you need rest of cast to be goodly you don't need to make Eiza as villain and don't need to make her as villain father just make her as lead or just cameo just being a good girl character whatever you wanna call it because her character in this movie was pointless and uselessand human actors were just boring nothing to them expect I love Eiza Gonzalez her character doesn't have to be bi*ch she but her character was but I don't blame her it's writers anyway. I thought main actor Alexander Skarsg\u00e5rd was just horrible bad acting horrible he is like a blank piece of paper that's his acting only movie I enjoyed was 13 (2010) but he is not main role in that movie but him as lead role in this movie was just crap acting and boring he is boring as a blank piece of paper they could used many other actors or just have Eiza Gonzalez as lead have a female that's something different or just have Kyle Chandler as lead like in Godzilla King of Monsters have him and Eiza Gonzalez team up together and then other character Rebecca Hall as Dr. Ilene Andrews\nA Monarch anthropological linguist witch she was nothing to her character at all she was boring and has terrible horrible acting but have her as cameo but just have Kyle Chandler and Eiza Gonzalez has lead. But no it has to be different role for different actor I don't mind that but casting is missed placed I thought some of other actors were just annoying as hell that what toke me out of movie even more and character direction like with Eiza Gonzalez not just her but other character direction was pointless does every new Godzilla sequels has to be different main actor??? Pointlessother plot hole of movie title doesn't relate to movie IT'S BATMAN VS SUPERMAN all over again this title should been called Godzilla & Kong because if theirs no winner well their was a winner in film but it's not winner winner but you have this main villain monster Mechagodzilla attacking city and killing people billions of people and then Godzilla and Kong is now teaming up even Godzilla won fight against Kong theirs your answer she when you make a VS movie like Alien VS Predator and Freddy VS Jason their was a winner they DIDN'T TEAM UP TOGETHER its one winner hates other challenger that's it not Godzilla and Kong teaming up after fight it's called Godzilla vs Kong they fight one wins, one goes down not they fight then you have other villain monster coming in they team up pointless just pointless human characters pointless having Godzilla and Kong battle each other pointless just so much plot holes see this title should be called Godzilla & Kong that's when you think they will team up together if it's VS one has to win and other has to lose but one wants that, no one has guts to do that sadly to say but in sametime I enjoyed film I never got bored, never got sleepy, it was a on going movie it was just fun to watch and never cared for actors just their for Godzilla and Kong that's all human actors you wanna say forget them your just their for action, monsters, and for fun, and for battle that's all you their for to see this movie I thought music choices were annoying as hell you will hear stupid dam lousey music in film like Elvis Presley music so many other annoying music in movie killed it that's what threw me out of movie, trailer of this movie just wants you to bring you in wants in exactly what I said you understand it, in other hand I enjoyed movie for fun for fun EPIC battles. CGI and sound was amazing but would have been nice to hear some of the original Godzilla theme and cinematography was great and Great action sequences I had with it but sametime to deal with punching holes in movie is something I can deal with but I can't deal with Godzilla (2014) film that's my opinion but this movie 6.10."}, {"reviewer_name": "wil-sut", "date": "5 April 2021", "text": "I thought it was good decent film..

And us viewers seem to be on a roll. They already delivered the year's one of the most awaited (and longest) action blockbusters with Zack Snyder's Justice League, and have now delivered another eye-popping, heart-stopping, jaw-dropping action blockbuster, Godzilla vs. Kong. It's no spoiler that the film centers on the epic clash between the two eponymous giant creatures, and the result is a massively entertaining film which reminds us why cinema going used to be such a pleasant experience in the pre-COVID times.It has decent human characters as well, and they don't feel overshadowed or eat up the entire plot either. Plus, the visuals in this film are so incredibly gorgeous that you can literally pause at any moment to get a magical, otherworldly, surreal wallpaper. The pacing is also a major plus, as the film moves pretty quick and keeps the action coming, with destruction scenes looking as epic as they can. Director Adam Wingard has done a fabulous job with this film, and has managed to deliver what fans of escapist cinema really desire from their movies.The action is intense and the film's big draw, especially the final battle where I was left breathless and could easily imagine crowds of viewers cheering in cinemas at certain moments. The background score accompanying most of the sequences is good, and the visual effects are fantastic. All this makes me want to watch it once again and buy a Blu-ray copy when it becomes available in the future. Even without seeing the 2014 and 2019 Godzilla as well as the 2005 King Kong, I was able to understand the plot and enjoy it without being bored for even a second.Although the story is as simple as it can get, Godzilla vs Kong's success in captivating you with its all-out action spectacle is a reminder that cinema is first and foremost an escapist experience, and films that do this notion justice are lapped up more easily by majority of the viewers. No doubt this film too has passed the test with flying colors and has satisfied many fans craving this kind of popcorn-friendly fun.

A legendary duel between two giants of cinema. And while yes, the action was great; the plot(s), its writing, and its characters are just plain old mediocre and actually pretty bad at times.So lets get this plot problem out of the way first before I talk about how much I loved (for the most part) the action involved. The main plot was fine but boy was that subplot featuring Stranger Things girl and who two bumbling stooge cohorts terrible. The writing was just bad, no character depth, plus a level of cringe worthy, hackneyed quips and jokey lines that are enough to make you roll your eyes and just beg for the next action sequence to come. In fact, I don't think we even really need those characters at all. That arch of the story could have been told in a totally different way and the film would have been much better off for it. The main plot was ok in my opinion, I don't want to spoil the things not in the trailer but their origins and getting to see the homeland of the Titans was interesting enough, accented by characters who weren't as bad as the sub plot, but were nothing memorable.No the action, loved it. The first action scene was pretty good though the true battle was pretty awesome, for the most part. Some of the camera angles were not the best for the scene, I liked most of it though including the shots from inside buildings which was a nice nod to the Gareth Evans reboot that I personally like a lot. The visuals are spectacular, it was fantastic to see them duke it out in/destroy the city the final fight takes place. Also that semi-twist in the story that, honestly, the internet saw coming a mile away, was fun for me personally because I remember it from when I was a kid. And with that \"other thing\" that happens, they portrayed him in a serviceable way and I think the did a pretty good job, considering how delicate it must have been designing that \"creature\".All in all I'd saw get yourself a month of free HBO Max and skip through the human drama and just absorb the awesome action."}, {"reviewer_name": "matinmeftahi", "date": "4 April 2021", "text": "In my opinion, The subject of the film itself is very attracting to the action-science-fiction audience, and everyone was counting on it for that moment.

Since its announcement, the studio planned for this to be the epic everything-leads-to movie, much like the Marvel solo hero films lead to \"The Avengers\". Although its being released at the end of our pandemic nightmare, its box-office receipts will determine if we get any more of these big-budget, CGI-heavy, popcorn movies. \"Godzilla vs. Kong\" suffers from the same problem that has plagued the entire series (and popcorn films in general), it has a weak plot and many plot holes. The first 20 or so minutes of the film is slow, dismal and suffers on many levels but once Godzilla and King Kong meet for the first time, the film's pace is better and the entertainment level rises tremendously...that is if you like to watch a couple of CGI behemoths battle it out. I can understand if this is not everyone's cup of tea but should you enjoy the idea of a giant ape and a towering reptile duke it out in epic fashion, the rest of the film will be exactly what you are looking for. The film delivers the action much better than any of the previous films. While director Adam Wingard does offer some slight, subtle nods to the original \"King Kong vs. Godzilla\" he also sways away from some traditional touches like the Godzilla theme song. But let's admit that the cast is weak and the script they are given is about as bad as it gets. Millie Bobby Brown is fast becoming an overrated star and I am wondering if my first impression of her was too kind when I predicted she would be a superstar for years. Alexander Skarsg\u00e5rd never wins us over and when we want to start to hate his character, he does enough to prevent us from hoping Kong steps on him. Julian Dennison & Brian Tyree Henry are just annoying and prove distracting with thier story along with Brown, but thank goodness their silly story is reduced more and more as the monster's battles pick up. If you have enjoyed the Monsterverse films up to this point, this will b e a film that will either be the crown jewel bow on the top or the film that could be the one that opens things up to eve better films.

Strongly recommend for any action lovers out there."}, {"reviewer_name": "darkreignn", "date": "4 April 2021", "text": "The Godzilla and Kong cinematic universe sprung into inception with the genuinely suspenseful \"Godzilla,\" released theatrically in 2014. With a plot that focused heavily on the world's reaction to the sudden realization that giant monsters, dubbed Titans, walk among us, \"Godzilla\" steadily built suspense by keeping the titular lizard in the background. While this choice seemed to rub some people the wrong way, I thought it was masterful, as the film built toward a genuinely exciting conclusion, made all the more thrilling thanks to its previous level of restraint.\"Kong: Skull Island\" came next, and took a slightly different approach - where \"Godzilla\" was determined to be a serious film that explored the psychological implications of discovering Titans exist, \"Skull Island\" took a more light-hearted and colorful approach, harking back to 80's and 90's action films. And you know what? It worked for what it was trying to do, and the film was fun for what it was. \"Godzilla: King of the Monsters,\" was the next film in the series, and garnered almost unanimously poor reviews; with an overly serious, boring tone that focused more on bland human characters than the monsters everyone wants to see, the film didn't seem to please fans of the 2014 flick, or newcomers who just wanted to see some CGI Titan action. The so-called monster-verse seemed to be in a bind, and then \"Godzilla vs. Kong\" was announced. How does it compare to the other film's in the series?\"Godzilla vs. Kong\" has its moments - the fights in this movie are completely and utterly badass, and are meant to be experienced on the biggest screen possible. I watched this on HBO Max, and the entire time I desperately wished I would've hit up my local theatre instead. The scale of the action is immense, with Godzilla and Kong tearing up cities, oceans, and anything else that's standing in their way, all to assert dominance over one another. There can only be one Titan at a time, and Godzilla is determined to stay King of the Monsters. But what's a king to a God? Kong certainly holds his own in the battles, and watching him employ a variety of dirty, street-fighting type moves against Godzilla was so entertaining that I couldn't stop smiling during the fights. The last act, especially, is thrilling, with both Godzilla and Kong getting ample time to shine and show off their combat skills.Unfortunately, everything that isn't a big CGI fight is pretty boring. The film, once again, focuses on a wide-array of human characters, specifically Alexander Skarsg\u00e5rd, Millie Bobby Brown, and Rebecca Hall. And honestly, they weren't necessarily poor in this film - all of them had entertaining, animated personalities that, while mildly amusing to watch, were obviously and strategically utilized to make up for the excruciating amount of exposition they dump. I mean, I'm not smart, but I'm not dumb enough to fall for this film's tricks. More than half of this movie's run time focuses on these characters explaining things to each other, and the only reason it is tolerable is because they act like characters you'd expect to find in a Saturday morning cartoon. And I realize that budgetary constraints make it impossible for the studio to make a two hour film of just crazy action scenes, but surely they could fill up the film with something other than people talking to each other.Millie Bobby Brown reprises her role from \"King of the Monsters,\" and while I remember liking her in that film, I couldn't stand her in this. She bands together with two other characters, and every time they appear on screen, all tension and momentum plummets. Their subplot is awfully boring, especially when you realize that they were only in the movie for one specific purpose that I will not spoil. Their scenes could have been easily cut, and the movie would've been shorter, tighter, and more entertaining because of it. Also, all three of them act so horrifically ridiculous, as if they were directed to act like they were in a parody. Sure, I don't need my movies to be 100% serious, but when you have literal monsters wrecking the world to tear one another apart, I expect a semblance of fear, anxiety, or worry. And that brings me to another complaint: the tone.This movie felt so cheesy, mostly due to its overly light-hearted tone. From the start, the movie opens with an out of place song choice, and halfway through another out of place song plays, and once again at the film's end, as well. And while I enjoyed the songs, they just didn't mesh with this movie. The music choices, the over-saturation, the cartoonish personalities of the characters, all of it was throwing me off and didn't allow me to get invested in the plot or the characters. Again, I understand a movie about a giant lizard and a giant gorilla is inherently silly, but the over the top and apparent silliness of the tone made me feel like I was watching a parody.Look, if you want to see monsters fight each other, you can do a lot worse than this film. The battle scenes are truly breathtaking, and I couldn't stop myself from smiling during them. However, a few good scenes doesn't make a good movie, and \"Godzilla vs. Kong\" suffers from an overabundance of boring exposition and uninteresting characters."}, {"reviewer_name": "christianpapel", "date": "4 April 2021", "text": "Finally, we get to see these two titans battle it now in this modern age.

The story isn't really great but it's at least good, the villain(s) actually have a motivation too, but now let's get to what you really wanna see, the friggin monsters and wow, it's amazing. There's no breathers in most of the action and rarely any cutaways, and it even gets brutal at some points, especially when Godzilla starts beating the ever living crap out of Kong and in the fight against MechaGodzilla, and the action is so fast paced that you never get bored during it. Next up, the actual plot itself, is stupendously fun. Some of the stuff in this movie is pretty stupid, but it makes up for it with the things I previously mentioned, so if you're looking for something profound you're in the wrong place, just expect some monsters to beat the crap out of each other and you'll be happy.

I purchased tickets for a late, evening projection. I have to admit that this pandemic atmosphere added a special feeling to this movie, as there was only ten people in the entire cinema. Earlier projection had a bigger audience, though.After solid success of 'Godzilla' and 'Godzilla II: King of the Monsters', excitement was built for an epic clash between two apex monsters on Earth - the mighty, magnificent and awe-inspiring 393 feet giant lizard - Godzilla. On the other side we have Kong, an immensely strong and powerful giant ape who grew to 337 feet and got introduced in 2017's Kong: Skull Island. It's well known that both beasts are good-hearted and protect humans, as well as Earth from other Kaiju and evil human threats.It is suggested by the title that something will set Godzilla and Kong after one another, with humans stuck between two ferocious monsters. Compliant to all other prequels set in newly created Monsterverse, 'Godzilla vs. Kong' suffers to same deficiencies as its.predecessors.- weak human plot, uninteresting and boring characters. For instance, I thought Bernie Hayes (Brian Tyree Henry) was going to have a bigger role. He did have a lot of screen time, but teaming up with kids (Madison/Josh) reduced his overall importance, especially because of MBB. I didn't enjoy this story arc a lot. Also, considering he is an Apex employer gone rogue, there was far too little at stake for Bernie. I was hoping Mark Russell (Kyle Chandler) will have a bigger role since I liked him in King of the Monsters.Overall, humans are condensed to military personnel or scientists who are trying to connect the dots for the audience - what makes sense from a storytelling perspective. I know that a lot of fans want humans gone, and I understand why - sometimes I'm not sure what story are writers trying to tell with humans.There are definitely more monsters screen time in 'Godzilla vs. Kong' than in previous Monsterverse films - which makes sense because there are two monster protagonists. CGI was brilliant, all creatures looked fantastic, real and mighty!FINAL VERDICT: 'Godzilla vs. Kong' is an entertaining clash between two well beloved characters. It's a clear improvement compared to 'Godzilla II: King of Monsters' and it expands the Monsterverse. Amazing fight scenes make up for relatively boring human arc. It was a memorable return to IMAX cinemas and I'd strongly recommend it!RATING: 7.4/10."}, {"reviewer_name": "pgann3700", "date": "4 April 2021", "text": "Delivers on CGI and fight scenes were entertaining.

In fact, he's gone on a rampage. What to do? Why, recruit Kong, of course, who has been whiling away his time back on Skull Island in something called a \"Kong Containment Center.\" Soon--and predictably--the two are butting heads (with a handful of other nasties joining the fray, but I won't spoil anything by revealing their identities here) like a pair of behemoths at Wrestlemania. As usual, the only reason to watch this epic showdown between Special K and the Big G--apparently, their first mano a mano ever--is the special effects, and they are, admittedly, whether on land, sea, or in the air, jaw-droppingly spectacular. Unfortunately (and this is fairly typical as well), the story is dumb, the dialogue silly, and the characters about as three-dimensional as recycled cardboard. The presence of a cute little girl whose sole purpose seems to be to serve as a kind of dimple-cheeked \"Kong whisperer\" doesn't help, either. Nor does the occasional--and decidedly unfunny--comic relief. I guess when you have the money--plus access to so much movie-making technology--this kind of time-waster is pretty much inevitable.

That being said, it was a mindless special effects bonanza that brought me back to the golden age of corny monster movies and made me forget COVID for a couple hours."}, {"reviewer_name": "snknight-98010", "date": "4 April 2021", "text": "Ok this movie was everything I wanted and more, so much more that I didn't expect it, especially with everything happening in Hollywood with movies in these times of woke and cancel cultures. The best thing about it was, huge monsters no matter how big they are, don't have political, sexist and/or woke agendas. This movie was pure entertainment and escapism from start to finish. In other words, it was just what the doctor ordered, totally EPIC!I can't wait to see what the Hollywood SJW's are going to find wrong with this movie? I mean, are they going to be angry that both Godzilla and King Kong are both males? This movie will definitely appeal to my generation (GenX) who grew up watching Godzilla movies. Heck my mother used to drop me off at the theater on Sundays where they played 4 Godzilla movies for $1, Something no sane parent would do in these times that's for sure.So, bottom line, any and all fans of Godzilla and King Kong movies will be totally delighted and leave the cinema theater with a smile and feeling of satisfaction with maybe a sense/wish that the movie would of lasted a little longer. Whether you have to be wearing a mask for the length of the movie, it's still worth your money, wearing a mask and definitely worth your time. And mask SJW's should stay away.Again whether you are a full out Godzilla/King Kong fan, casual fan or a normie, this movie is worth the money and definitely worth your time. This is no Shakespeare inspired movie and/or no Martin Scorsese and other big name known directors kind of movie, meaning this isn't an Oscar best plot or great acting. This a 1:53 hour/mins of total escapism/entertainment and as such, it definitely serves it's purpose. Like it's previous predecessor \"Godzilla: King of the Monsters\", this new movie, definitely brought out the little kid in me again and with so many childhood memories (but that's just me).I highly recommend watching this movie!"}, {"reviewer_name": "joe-musheno", "date": "4 April 2021", "text": "But really the great ends there.

Except for the conspiracy theory guy, he was hella annoying.Why is half the movie's lighting neon bright colors? It's very lazy and doesn't fit at all.The hollow Earth stuff was bonkers and cool.

The movie would have been a thousand times better if they had spent most of the time down there, maybe show a Kong society and a battle between Kong and the ruler of hollow Earth, thus making him... King Kong. Come on, it writes itself. I don't know why are they still afraid of making the monsters actual characters, the comics are doing that and they are way more fun than the last 4 Monsterverse movies. I mean... It's not like there's not going to be any dialogue, the movie shows Kong is capable of talking via sign language and the movie has already a lot of subtitles because of little deaf girl, people wouldn't mind.

Kong is a great movie an absolutely fun movie. This movie does something different than the other movies. Now I like the other 3 movies but this movie does something different this movie introduces the Character Jia who has a connection with Kong and this connection shows us the more emotional side of Kong. I believe that this made this movie better because before at least when I watched I didn't care who won the fight but in this movie you feel a emotional connection with Kong because of his friendship with Kia. For example when Kong is about to go help Godzilla fight Mechagodzilla you see the bond between Kia and Kong because as Kong is about to go help she warns Kong to be careful with emotion and I think that with that alone putting aside the other scenes between the two bonding this really showed the connection between these two and I think that it made it 100% better. As usual the fight scenes are the best and the effects are great. So the thing I don't like now this is a huge and I mean huge upgrade for the humans the other movies I was wishing the human scenes would end but in this movie the human scenes have become more watchable a big improvement from the last few movies. Also I like that in this movie the characters crack some jokes instead of the last movie it seemed everyone was all depressed. The journey with Nathan, Ilene, and Kia is the best human parts but the scenes with Madison, Bernie, and Josh fall short of the Hollow Earth journey now I'm not saying it's all bad but some points just reminded me of the last movie. All in all everything was improved even if it didn't need improvement like the fight scenes this was a great movie! All that said I'm giving Godzilla Vs.

Yes, I'm fully aware of the fact that this is a monster movie and that's exactly what I expected -- a spectacular effects-driven battle between 2 titans and nothing else. It's good, it delivered exactly what was promised.The effects are top-notch, the fight scenes are spectacular and the story is orders of magnitudes better than its predecessor, simply by virtue of not being utterly brain-dead and moronic. Yes, giant monster movies have stupid stories by default, but King Of The Monsters felt like watcing your own brain die a slow death. Anyway, the human characters are actually tolerable this time around whereas in King of the Monsters they were utterly despicable in their stupidity. Kong himself got some nice and juicy characterization, making him the de facto protagonist of sorts, compared to Godzilla who pretty much kicks off the plot by acting like a colossal jerkass. But how else is the plot supposed to happen, right? Whatever, let them fight.So yes, if all you want is a movie about 2 larger-than-life titans duking it out in spectacular fashion, this is as good as it gets -- but don't be surprised if by the time you finished watching, you can barely recall anything you just saw, because that's how I feel about this movie: it was entertaining while I watched it, but now I'm done and don't really have a desire to re-watch it again.

The Kong from Peter Jackson's film is far more believable. I kinda was just so bored with every scene that wasn't the Titans. And I really think the story just made no sense.

In addition, there some human characters we can finally root for and give our humanly support. Especially, those who understand the beasts. However, just like Godzilla: King of Monsters, its stunning visuals, powerful action, memorizing score, well executed editing/pacing and the monsters themselves stole the show!

We also get to see a much more emotive Kong in this one. The battle scenes are what you'd expect, and I think a bit more intense (more buildings getting knocked over, etc). Very well done in that regard.But the weakest part of the movie was the absurd sub-plot of the dynamic trio kid caricatures. They find themselves in top secret facilities with ease and are stupidly lucky enough guess passcodes and passwords and dodge death at the last second... you've seen it before. They do the exact right thing at the exact right time to get to the next contrived plot point. Very predictable and silly. But at least they prevented disaster, if you don't count leveling an entire city in a fight between three titans, but nevermind that.If the human characters were as interesting as the titans in this movie, I'd give it a couple more stars. It's a step up from the ultra-corny \"family first\" 2nd part of the trilogy and is a far cry from the first one which was amazing, but it's still decent and watchable if you can get past the formulaic and ridiculous sub-plots and forced acting."}, {"reviewer_name": "timothyfatburg", "date": "4 April 2021", "text": "Like all other movies in this genre, the human focused storylines were quite boring and unoriginal.

The villains posed by this mega corporation are interesting without the need to make it a story of people from the last film. Aside from that haphazard storyline, it was a good movie, it had a great concepts and awesome visuals. I just wish that film studios would spend a little more time developing the story's characters.Do you know why Zach Snyder's Justice League is awesome? Not because it's 4 hours and we are still in a pseudo quarantine lifestyle BUT because it's actually a well developed and executed story. Not an edited mess with no real motivations for any of the characters to do what they do. Don't sacrifice story, for runtime and your general disbelief in the public. The public enjoys a great story in any film category. Make it work, and they will enjoy it. Stop cutting down story to save time and money because what happens is the public tunes out.

We found the drawing of our two leading giants very successful, even the facial expressions they made reflected this feeling to us. I can say that we expect a much better performance from our actors in this movie, as if they were forced to act in the movie. As for the script part, the godzilla team is millie boby brown, jullian dennison and brian tyree henry. They didn't believe the news that Godzilla attacked people for no reason. It was very enjoyable to watch the godzillas investigate why they attacked people and the events that happened to them while they were investigating. The kong team Alexander Skarsgard, Rebecce Hall and Kayle Hottle. They were mostly tasked with guarding Kong, but they helped Kong find its true home, its true home and inherit its ancestral heritage, and the adventure they had in an empty place was quite enjoyable. As for the Godzilla and Kong war, we look at it from two angles: the kong team and the godzilla team. As the Godzilla team, we were delighted to see Godzilla continue its success after the movie King of the Beasts and it really gave us the feeling of alpha titan but if we look at the event as the kong team this is very sad, this is not only the sequel to the godzilla movie, but also godzilla, the sequel to the kong skull island movie. We have seen that the dominant beast is constantly and kong is constantly returning from death. Not to mention his battle with Godzilla, he killed Nozuki, one of the simplest monsters in the hollow world, with human help, if we come to his fight with the godzilla. We think he can't use the ax actively, that this ax was given to Kong to rival the godzilla, and it's ridiculous that Kong can't use it in this movie. Some people were upset when one side was defeated while there was a common enemy in the film. It was a good movie for Godzilla fans, a disgrace for kong fans and it didn't need it, but ultimately it was a good movie for the monster universe.

The trilogy has been completely cancelled and now the fans are crying and demanding to restore the synderverse. At least Godzilla vs. Kong was not cancelled and we got to see the movie.Remember. They only plan to make more such movies based on the reviews and the revenue we guys give it to them. If they think, the future installments will get the same ranting, then they will never plan to reboot or make sequels to such movies.Stop nitpicking and enjoy the damn movie."}, {"reviewer_name": "MAHMUD-420", "date": "3 April 2021", "text": "The battles were just awesome.

The fisrt Godzilla and Kong: Skull Island were decent films. But, after Godzilla 2, I was sure that Universal had no intention to improve what they were getting wrong in those movies. Now, Godzilla vs. Kong is here. The question is: Did it improve upon the earlier installments of the series?No, Godzilla vs. Kong has most of the same issues of the other Monsterverse movies. The human part is still pretty bad. Most of the actors (Millie Bobby Brown, Alexander Skarsg\u00e5rd, Rebecca Hall and Eiza Gonz\u00e1lez) don't know what to do with their characters, because they are horribly written. The ones that kinda know (Brian Tyree Henry and Kaylee Hottle) do not get the deserved attention, neither from the script, nor direction.Kong is the protagonist of this movie. Which was a really good decision, because we can see a lot of what's happening from his perspective. Godzilla is mostly, the antagonist. And Mechagodzilla is just thrown out there, just so we can have a battle where both Kong and Godzilla unite against him.There are 3 battles throughout the movie. They are all amazing battles. Really amazing battles. Adam Wingard nailed them. Those fights are what sustain the entire movie. I never thought that only action could sustain a movie like this. I'm glad I was wrong.The story is also incredibly bad. It looks like the writers said: You know what? I don't even care anymore. And they wrote absolutely anything in the script. Sometimes, It felt like I was watching Journey to the Center of the Earth 2. They literally put the freaking Hollow Earth in the movie. It is incredibly stupid. Stupidity that this movie does not shy away from.The movie also fails to build an argument on why Kong should be fighting Godzilla. I found little to zero reasons on why they should be fighting.If you are the kind of person that can watch a movie without caring about the story or characters. Congratulations, you won the lottery.

Truly, fans of the Godzilla franchise were happy to see a movie grounded in reality, but not afraid to deliver the goods when it came to monster movie madness. Unfortunately, the franchise has steered its way more toward video game fantasy than anything resembling Edward's origin story.GvK spends a lot of time explaining things that never make any sense just to stage elaborate fights between a lizard and an ape. There is some nonsense about hollow earth. Apparently, Kong has grown too big for Skull Island and needs to be moved to his \"forever\" home. The movie makes no attempt to explain how or why Kong ended up on Skull Island if his ancestral home is in the middle of the earth. Also, he's learned sign language from a little girl. And, not just a few basic words, but a fairly extensive vocabulary for a giant monkey in the wild. It's a testament to his powers of observation that he can even see her tiny hands, let alone attach any meaning to her gestures. But, whatever.Godzilla, in the meantime, is raging on everyone and everything. There's something in the script that suggests his anger has been triggered by some unknown force. But, whatever. He's a giant lizard that breathes fire, so who are we to judge.Mechagodzilla also makes an appearance. His brain is powered by a human interface or something, but not really. He's hardwired to be an apex predator because the Monster Zero head from the last movie...blah, blah, blah. But, whatever.And, we finally get to see hollow earth. It's surprisingly easy to get to. You just have to wear an Adidas inspired track suit and bring a barf bag. There is also where Kong finds his \"forever\" axe and turns into Thorin Oakenshield.There are a bunch of humans running around saying stupid things and doing stupider things. That any of the actors could deliver a single line of script without giggling or barfing into their own mouths says a lot. All the actors in this film should fire their agents straight away. Except for that Skarsgard dude. This is exactly what we should expect from him.In the end, the monsters fight, the people talk. It's all very spectacularly boring.This is a movie was made by people whose idea of fun is perching in a chair that smells of stale taco meat and pizza farts playing video games and swilling copious amounts of energy drinks all day.

Sure, it was hokey, but it also put two iconic monster characters in a fighting match.Enter 2021 Godzilla vs. Kong. This is the first one of the Legendary pictures that really understood Godzilla and how Godzilla films need to work: monster-centric, humans as window dressing and largely powerless.So after barely seeing the title character in Godzilla 2014 and dealing with the annoyingly human-centric Godzilla: King of the Monsters, this is the first time we really got to see Godzilla do his thing on screen without constantly cutting away for boring human B-plots. No, this was the full shebang. And King Kong? Great action and character. Loved him as a character in the flawed but good Kong: Skull Island. Loved him now.This movie GOT how Godzilla movies are supposed to be about the creature feature. Complete with the city destruction and some screaming crowds. Needed more screaming crowds, but I'll take what I can get.But what about the people? Well, there were two main groups of people in this movie.The one involved an excellent Kong-centric storyline where we got to see the softer side of Kong. I liked that human storyline. It was dramatic, heartfelt, and often intense. Unlike in previous Legendary Godzilla movies, I truly cared what happened to these human characters, especially the little girl.The other one was comic relief. I liked the new podcaster character - and would like to see more of the actor in other films - but the two teenagers were kind of shoehorned in. This was the weakest part of the film. This human storyline also dragged in Millie Brown from Godzilla: King of the Monsters. Fortunately, the other human characters from the previous film were sidelined.Overall, this film hit the correct Godzilla magic mix: Make it all about the monsters. For the most part, we got to see humans as they related to the monsters, not each other. Every relationship was either monster-centric or monster-influenced. The monsters were in charge. Fantastic.If Legendary can repeat this, I'll be enjoying Legendary Godzilla AND King Kong movies for a long time to come. It put a smile on my face the whole way through, just like the 1962 version did when I was a kid.One thing though: The music in Godzilla films has never been a big deal except for in the first one. While the Godzilla theme was used, I'd appreciate it if Legendary upped the use of music in future films. Get Michael Giacchino.

Seeing as I watched this on HBO on a borrowed account I'd say I got what I paid for and then some.Side note- I love how calculating both Titans were, especially Kong. The fact that he sat there and waited until Godzilla got up from his stupor to then throw the skyscraper at him was hilarious. Reminds me of two young brothers fighting in the living room. One gets hurt so he needs to have a time-out but as soon as he gets back up the other brother knocks him upside the head with a couch cushion. Don't mind me. I have random thoughts at odd times.Continuing on, if at possible I'd love the next movie (because you already know that it's coming) to feature less human interaction and more Titan development. Let's explore Kong's home a bit more too. There is surely much more lurking around that he hasn't encountered yet. Perhaps even another Kong!!"}, {"reviewer_name": "ScourgetheDarkClaw", "date": "3 April 2021", "text": "Film Review: Godzilla vs. KongDirected by Adam Wingard, this fourth film of the Monsterverse, after Godzilla, Kong: Skull Island, and Godzilla: Kong of the Monsters, is a film I've been waiting for ever since it was teased in Kong: Skull Island. This film has been in the making for nearly sixty years. The original version of this titanic battle was released in 1962, which is as old as my father to give perspective. I watched this film today with him and my mom, wearing my Godzilla vs. Kong shirt, which I bought from Amazon. If I had to sum up the film on one word, it would be: Amazing.The film stars Alexander Skarsg\u00e5rd, Millie Bobby Brown, Rebecca Hall, Brian Tyree Henry, Shan Oguri, Eiza Gonz\u00e1lez, Julian Dennison, Lance Reddick, Kyle Chandler, Demi\u00e1n Bichir, and newcomer Kaylee Hottle, the film's synopsis is: \"\nThe epic next chapter in the cinematic Monsterverse pits two of the greatest icons in motion picture history against one another-the fearsome Godzilla and the mighty Kong-with humanity caught in the balance.\"Its performances are compelling, with Skarsg\u00e5rd, Hall, Brown, Henry, Dennison, and Bichir all doing great, but it's newcomer Hottle who steals the show as Jia, a little deaf girl (with her actress coming from an all-deaf family) from Skull Island who has been able to communicate with Kong and became his greatest friend and ally.The action is epic, being nonstop and heart-pounding. The battle scenes that take place in Hong Kong and the Hollow Earth, as well as on the Tasman Sea, are shot beautifully, and I was on the edge of my seat the whole time. This is helped by the perfect nature of the visuals, with the CGI for Godzilla, Kong, and the other Titans, as well as other important aspects like machines and locations looking so real.The score by Tom Holkenborg (Junkie XL) is awesome, fitting every scene so well. My favorite tracks, other than the main themes for both main characters, are: \"A New Language,\" \"The Throne,\" \"Tasman Sea,\" \"Mega,\" and \"Hong Kong.\" For him to do both Zack Snyder's Justice League and this film, and for this film to be released so close to that one, allows me to listen to two of the best scores I've ever heard.Finally, the direction by Wingard, the story, and the editing is extremely well-done. Without it being so good, the film would not be as great as it is. Thanks to all this, a perfect film has been created.In conclusion, this film and Zack Snyder's Justice League alone are reasons to get one month of HBO Max. Godzilla vs. Kong is a thrill ride that does not let down. I love it immensely, with it now ranking as my top Monsterverse film, and I can't wait to watch it again!Rating: 10/10."}, {"reviewer_name": "rachel-sibiosanchez", "date": "3 April 2021", "text": "The CGI was great assuming you have a TV that can handle it.

KONG is one of the most entertaining films of the year thus far, and demands to be watched on the biggest screen with the best sound possible. It gives fans of the franchise everything they could possibly want and more with bombastic and ridiculously destructive sequences that often outdo the previous films. I had a smile on my face during every fight sequence, and those fights take up much of the film's runtime.One of the main criticisms of this film is that the human characters are far less interesting than the titans, and while this is correct, I don't think it held the movie back from being consistently engaging and fun. My main criticism is that one particular storyline had no reason to be in the movie whatsoever and never connects itself to the rest of the plot, but it was still entertaining to watch so I can't complain too much. The fight sequences are so well-filmed and even gorgeous at times that it's almost impossible to fathom how they captured the footage. The sound design and visual effects couldn't be better, making for a visual and auditory experience like no other.At the end of the day, GODZILLA VS. KONG isn't going to reinvent cinema as we know it or change people's perspective on modern-day social issues, but it will provide some much-needed serotonin for two hours, which is exactly what I and many other fans are looking for.

Performances are medicore and in the shadow of the CGI work. Directing and editing are not better than other elements as well.

Well each animal in its habitat au natural rules by virtue of the survival of the fittest. Kong rose to taking over an entire island and ruled earning the name \"KING\" Kong in the process. Godzilla rules wherever he swims to or lands. These two territorial monsters have what it takes to rule, conquer and prevail. To say that one is mightier than the other is not a fair scenario. In this movie, we are treated to various combats and scenarios allowing us to admire both Kong and Godzilla respectfully. It gets interesting as we visit with unexplored worlds, new concepts and the movie ends with one knowing that those monsters that rule must continue to do so until they cannot. We also realize that these monsters have distinct enemies and enemies they encounter along the way. In monster verse, this movie is very real and we get invited into this world in awe thanks to nice scenes, lots of roaring and new territory to ponder. One thing that disturbs the fantasy and immersion aspect for the viewer is the use of the words 'oh my god\", Jesus Christ and various mixes of it. Why is this intrusive? GOD is the ultimate super power and CREATOR and shouldn't be mentioned so freely in these movies because it destroys the illusion and takes away from the grandiose of being in and of this land of monsters and their adventures. I mean GOD literally rules...right? How about leaving GOD out of this and give us more to ponder, consider, wow and wonder which this movie touches upon. Wide open for sequels, ongoing stories and of course entertainment that invites snacks, tasty drinks and good distraction from our daily do this and that routines.

Now what this MonsterVerse has done in past years is that they have set the grand scales by bringing more than one monster in a single film which expanded the visual segments of it. Godzilla Vs Kong is probably the best in this my series so far and overall the best since Peter Jackson's King Kong (2005). It overlooks the quality proportions while focusing on the humongous framework but still somehow manages to put up a highly entertaining show on big screen.The epic next chapter in the cinematic Monsterverse pits two of the greatest icons in motion picture history against one another - the fearsome Godzilla and the mighty Kong - with humanity caught in the balance. Story wise, this one is easy to predict even without thinking too much and somewhere at the halfway you get the sure shot idea of how's it gonna turn in the end. Well, to be honest Monsterverse was never about stories or writing or nuances in the screenwriting so better that part be let alone. It's all about explosion, high octane action sequences, visual expansion of those mighty fictional characters and yes it doesn't lack anything there.Let's drop the whole idea of judging the acting category as we all know the two of the leading stars in the film are monsters, not humans so obviously they couldn't act. Well, it doesn't mean the human actors haven't acted at all, they certainly have and in pretty decent manners. It is just that we don't look for them or their acting while watching the monstrosity. Talking about the VFX and entire visual appeal of the film, this one has fared much better than the on paper material. Like mentioned above, this is over-sized film hurt by limited vision so it would have been even bigger than expected and what it is if the vision had reached to an unthinkable level. It has problems appearing in humongous sequences where the visual effects look like an animated film but only at some occasions, rest, it is bang on!Adam Wingard had a huge burden on his shoulder to carry and there is no doubt that he has carried it well enough. He missed few things here and there while executing this mammoth saga but that's fine. However, it would have been better if he hadn't left few scenes completely unnoticed which are totally disastrous. He should have worked on it during post production with the editor and sound designer and Godzilla Vs Kong would have been much better and more accurate experience than what it is. Overall, Godzilla Vs Kong is a perfect entertainer considering the expectations you have from monsterverse and visually it's surely overwhelming.RATING - 6/10*"}, {"reviewer_name": "moyetbear-224-584960", "date": "31 March 2021", "text": "Too many plot holes to count, starting with something called SCIENCE, forget what you know and enjoy your popcorn.The kids, annoying and need better supervision, stealing a car, breaking into places, skipping school.

To balance that, Kong is given an equivalent of Thor's hammer, an axe with a glowing blue blade that can resist Godzilla's flame and in return wreck havocs with every swing delivered by the powerful arm of Kong. From day one, Kong was a good guy, sort of, misunderstood and mistreated by humans. Last time I checked, Godzilla was made into a good guy. In order to be pitched them against each other, one has to be cast into the role of a bad guy, even if temporarily. The plot is too far-fetched to be taken seriously, including subterranean worm holes that connect the Antarctica, the western seaboard of North America, Tasmania, and Hong Kong, where the final action extravaganza takes place. When two alphas are pitched one against another, the outcome has to see that only one remaining standing when the dust settles, or has it? With a plot twist that you can see coming right from the beginning, the device of a common foe serves the purpose of arriving at a truce, even if temporarily, until the sequel. The device is also quite familiar, if you are a fan of the Terminator: real life forms against machines. The narrative is formulaic, with parallel trajectories, when the two meet at the midpoint of the movie in the sort of dress rehearsal, feeling out each other's power and possible weak spots. Between that and the converging end with the climactic clash of these two titans, they each has plenty of fun with lesser minions of the monster world. How about the human supporting cast? On Kong's side are Alexander Skarsgard and Rebecca Hall as a familiar of understanding, supporting scientists. Completing the trio is adorable little Kaylee Hottle, playing the little girl that captures Kong's attention when everybody else fails to. Thrown in for good measure is bad gal schemer played by Eiza Gonzaler who you may remember from \"Baby driver\" as a murderous femme fatale called \"darling\". On Godzilla's side, we having coming back from the prequel the father-and-daughter pair Kyle Chandler and Millie Bobby Brown. Chandler is pretty much a cameo, appearing only at the beginning and the end. Brown I must confess I hardly remember from the previous Godzilla movie. But then, I had not yet seen her in the brilliant TV series \"Stranger things\" where she plays one of the lead roles, mesmerizing as an adolescent with super power. For me, she is the most familiar face, as well as brightest spot in this movie. The other two in her trio are Brian Tyree Henry playing a DJ with an investigative mind and Julian Dennison in a typical funny sidekick role. I am happy with the action sequences and special effects. I didn't expect anything more."}, {"reviewer_name": "parameswaranrajendran", "date": "25 March 2021", "text": "Godzilla Vs Kong is a lighter and simplest version of Batman v Superman Dawn of Justice. Visually stunning and I enjoyed it in IMAX."}]
